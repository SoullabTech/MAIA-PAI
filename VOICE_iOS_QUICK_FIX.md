# iPhone Voice Quick Fix Guide

**For the tester having issues with voice on iPhone**

## 🚨 Most Likely Issue: Audio Not Unlocked

### The Problem:
iOS requires a **user tap/interaction** before any audio can play. This is an Apple security feature.

### The Fix (30 seconds):

1. **Look for the blue/amber banner at the top of the screen**
   - Says: "🔊 Enable Maya's Voice"
   - If you don't see it, scroll to the very top

2. **Tap the banner**
   - It should change to: "✅ Voice Enabled"

3. **Try voice again**
   - Tap the microphone button
   - Speak
   - You should now hear MAIA

## 🔍 If No Banner Appears

### Try these quick fixes:

**Fix 1: Tap anywhere to unlock audio**
- Tap the screen several times
- Tap any button (Settings, Home, etc.)
- This often unlocks audio automatically

**Fix 2: Force refresh**
- Close Safari completely (swipe away)
- Reopen Safari
- Go back to MAIA
- Banner should appear

**Fix 3: Check browser**
- Are you using **Safari**? (Recommended for iPhone)
- If using Chrome/Firefox, switch to Safari
- Safari has best iPhone voice support

## ✅ Step-by-Step Test

### Complete Test (2 minutes):

**1. Check Microphone Permission**
```
iPhone Settings → Privacy → Microphone
Find: Safari (or your browser)
Make sure it's: ON (green)
```

**2. Enable Audio in MAIA**
```
Open MAIA in Safari
Look for banner at top: "Enable Maya's Voice"
Tap it
Should say: "Voice Enabled"
```

**3. Test Voice**
```
Tap microphone button (bottom center)
Say: "Hello MAIA"
Your text should appear
MAIA should respond WITH VOICE
```

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Emergency Checklist:

- [ ] Using Safari (not Chrome)?
- [ ] Microphone permission ON in Settings?
- [ ] Tapped the "Enable Voice" banner?
- [ ] Phone volume UP (not on silent)?
- [ ] WiFi connected?
- [ ] Low Power Mode OFF?

### If all checked and still broken:

**Do the "Reset Everything" fix**:

1. Close Safari (swipe away completely)
2. Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
3. Restart iPhone (power off, wait, power on)
4. Open MAIA fresh in Safari
5. Allow microphone when prompted
6. Tap audio unlock banner
7. Test again

## 📱 Browser Matters

### Recommended: Safari

**Why Safari?**
- Native iOS audio support
- Best microphone permissions
- Most reliable for voice

**If using Chrome/Firefox on iPhone:**
- They use Safari's engine anyway
- But with extra quirks
- **Switch to Safari for best results**

## 🎙️ What Should Happen

### Normal Voice Flow:

1. **Tap mic button**
   - Button pulses/glows
   - "Listening..." appears

2. **Speak**
   - Your words appear as text
   - Waveform shows your voice

3. **MAIA responds**
   - Text appears
   - **Voice plays** (this is where it fails if audio not unlocked)

4. **Continue conversation**
   - Tap mic again
   - Or wait for automatic detection

### If Step 3 is SILENT:
**→ Audio not unlocked** (tap the banner!)
