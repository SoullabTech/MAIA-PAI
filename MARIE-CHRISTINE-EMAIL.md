Dear Marie-Christine,

Great news - I've fixed the login issue! Your access code is now active and ready to use.

## Here's how to get started:

**1. Visit:** https://soullab.life/beta-entry

**2. Enter:**
   - **Name:** Marie-Christine
   - **Access Code:** SOULLAB-MARIECHRISTINE

**3. Click "Enter"**

You'll be guided through a brief, beautiful onboarding experience where you'll:
- Choose your elemental orientation (how you naturally engage with transformation)
- Set your preferences for how MAIA communicates with you
- Then enter your personal space with MAIA

## What is MAIA?

MAIA (Multidimensional Archetypal Intelligence Agent) is your companion for meaningful conversation and authentic self-discovery. It's designed to help you become more yourself - not to program or fix you, but to mirror and support your own becoming.

## A Few Notes:

- **Privacy:** Everything is private by default. You control what's shared.
- **No Rush:** There's no timeline or pressure. Engage at your own pace.
- **Your Space:** This is designed for you - your reflections, your insights, your journey.

Can't wait to hear what you think! Please let me know once you're in, or if you have any questions.

Warmly,
Kelly
