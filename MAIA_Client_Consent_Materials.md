## Introduction for Practitioners

### Why This Document Exists

Introducing AI into therapy requires **clear, honest communication** with clients. This document provides:

- Scripts for explaining MAIA in accessible language
- Answers to common client questions
- Sample consent forms (adapt to your practice)
- Strategies for handling concerns or refusals

### Core Principles

**1. Honesty**: Tell clients exactly what MAIA does (and doesn't do)
**2. Choice**: Clients can decline without affecting treatment quality
**3. Clarity**: No jargon, no minimizing, no overselling
**4. Safety**: Emphasize privacy, encryption, confidentiality

### When to Have This Conversation

**Option A: During intake** (before first session)
- Include in intake paperwork
- Discuss during informed consent process
- Client decides before therapy begins

**Option B: After relationship established** (sessions 2-3)
- Once client feels safe with you
- More context for why you'd use MAIA
- Client can see your judgment first

**Recommended**: **Option B** for most clients. Relationship first, then technology.

## Initial Explanation Scripts

### Script 1: Simple & Direct (90 seconds)

**When to use**: With clients who prefer straightforward information, minimal details.

---

**YOU**: I want to tell you about a tool I use to be a better therapist. It's called MAIA. Can I take a couple minutes to explain?

**[Client agrees]**

**YOU**: MAIA is an AI system—like an intelligent assistant—that helps me analyze our sessions. Here's how it works:

After we meet, I can upload a recording of our session. MAIA analyzes the conversation and gives me feedback—kind of like having a supervisor review my work. It helps me notice patterns I might miss and suggests frameworks that might help you.

During our sessions, I might also have MAIA running on my laptop—you won't see it, but it shows me real-time information like whether you're feeling more or less regulated. It's like having a second pair of eyes.

Here's what's important for you to know:

**Privacy**: Your sessions are encrypted and confidential, just like everything else in therapy. MAIA doesn't share your information anywhere.

**My judgment**: MAIA is a tool *I* use for *my* learning. It doesn't replace my judgment or our relationship. I'm still the therapist, and you're still the person I'm here for.

**Your choice**: You don't have to agree to this. If you'd rather I not use MAIA with you, that's completely fine. Your treatment won't change—I'll just use other supervision methods.

Do you have any questions? Or concerns?

---

### Script 2: Detailed & Transparent (3-4 minutes)

**When to use**: With clients who want full understanding, who value transparency, who may be anxious about AI.

---

**YOU**: There's something I want to discuss with you about how I approach my work as a therapist. I use a technology tool called MAIA, and I want to explain what it is, why I use it, and give you the choice about whether you're comfortable with it.

**What MAIA Is**:
MAIA stands for Morphic Alchemical Intelligence Augmentation. It's an AI system—artificial intelligence—designed specifically for therapists. It's basically like having a really knowledgeable colleague who reviews my sessions and gives me feedback.

**How It Works**:
There are two ways I might use it:

First, *after our sessions*, I can upload a recording, and MAIA analyzes the transcript. It looks for patterns—like whether you're moving through stages of transformation, what your nervous system is doing, what frameworks might be most helpful. Then it generates a supervision report for me. I read that report to learn about my work with you—where I'm doing well, where I might try something different.

Second, *during our sessions*, I might have MAIA running on my laptop. You won't see the screen, but it shows me real-time information—like a dashboard. It might tell me your stress level is rising, or that you just said something really significant, or suggest a framework I could try. I glance at it during natural pauses, kind of like checking a map while driving.

**Why I Use It**:
Honestly? Because I want to be the best therapist I can be for you. MAIA helps me see things I might miss. It's trained on 19 different therapeutic frameworks—way more than any one person can hold. So it's like having 19 expert consultants in the room (but quiet ones).

**What It Doesn't Do**:
MAIA doesn't make decisions. It doesn't diagnose you. It doesn't tell me what to do. It offers suggestions, and *I* decide what makes sense based on my relationship with you and my clinical judgment. The therapeutic relationship—you and me in this room—is what matters most. MAIA is just a support tool for me.

**Privacy & Security**:
Your sessions are encrypted—that means scrambled so only I can access them. MAIA's servers are HIPAA-compliant (the health privacy law). Your data isn't sold or shared. And if you ever want your sessions deleted, I can do that.

**Your Choice**:
You have complete choice here. If you say "No, I don't want MAIA used with our sessions," that is absolutely okay. I won't use it, and your therapy won't be any different—I'll just rely on my training, my supervisor, and my notes like I normally would.

If you say yes, you can also change your mind later.

**Questions**:
What questions do you have? Or concerns?

**[Pause, allow client to process and ask questions]**

---

### Script 3: Collaborative & Curious (2-3 minutes)

**When to use**: With clients who like being partners in their treatment, who are curious about psychology.

---

**YOU**: I've been thinking about whether to introduce a tool I use in my practice, and I wanted to run it by you to see what you think.

I use an AI system called MAIA—it's basically like having a really smart colleague who helps me analyze sessions. Some clients find it interesting, some are wary, and I want to know where you land.

Here's the deal: After we meet, I can have MAIA review our recording and give me feedback. It tells me things like "Your client crossed a threshold into a new stage of processing" or "You might have missed something at minute 23 when they paused." It helps me be more precise in understanding what's happening for you.

I can also use it during sessions—there'd be a little dashboard on my laptop showing me real-time information. You wouldn't see it, but I might glance at it to check in on how you're doing.

The reason I'm telling you is: **You get a say.** Some clients love the idea that I'm using cutting-edge tools to support them. Others feel weird about AI in therapy, which I totally get. If you'd rather I not use it with you, I won't, and our work will be just as good.

What's your gut reaction?

**[Client responds—see "Handling Client Concerns" section for how to respond to various reactions]**

## Client FAQ

### Questions Clients Ask (and How to Answer)

---

**Q1: "Is the AI judging me?"**

**A**: No. MAIA analyzes patterns in conversation—like stages of processing, emotional tone, nervous system states. It's not judging whether you're "good" or "bad," "healthy" or "sick." It's more like... imagine if you were learning a new language, and there was a system that could tell you "You're getting better at grammar" or "You tend to struggle with pronunciation of this sound." That's what MAIA does for transformation. It notices patterns, not judging the person.

---

**Q2: "Will this be used against me? Like in court or insurance?"**

**A**: Great question. Here's the honest answer:

**Insurance**: I don't share MAIA data with insurance companies. They get the same information they always get: diagnosis, dates of service. That's it.

**Court**: If there's ever a subpoena (legal order to release records), MAIA data *could theoretically* be included. That's the same risk as any therapy notes. I keep records to the minimum necessary, and I advocate for your privacy if a subpoena happens.

**The bottom line**: MAIA data is treated exactly like any other clinical record—confidential unless there's a legal or safety reason to share (like if you were in danger).

---

**Q3: "Is my session being recorded? Can I hear it?"**

**A**: Yes, if we use MAIA, sessions are recorded (audio only, no video). They're encrypted immediately—scrambled so only I can access them.

Can you hear the recording? That depends. Some therapists let clients review recordings as part of therapy (can be powerful). Others don't because it can change how the session feels. I'm open to discussing it if you're interested.

---

**Q4: "What if the AI gets it wrong about me?"**

**A**: Good question. MAIA gets things wrong sometimes—it's a tool, not magic. That's why *I'm* still the therapist. If MAIA says "Client seems to be in Stage X," and I disagree based on our relationship and my intuition, I trust my judgment.

Think of it like a GPS. Sometimes it says "Turn left," and you look and think, "That's not right." You don't follow it blindly. Same with MAIA—I use it as input, not authority.

---

**Q5: "This feels creepy. Is that weird?"**

**A**: Not weird at all. A lot of people feel that way about AI, especially in something as personal as therapy. I respect that feeling.

Can you tell me more about what feels creepy? Is it the recording part? The idea of AI analyzing your words? Feeling like you're being watched?

**[Listen to their specific concern, then address it. See "Handling Client Concerns" section.]**

If it still feels off after we talk, we don't have to use it. I want you to feel safe here, and that's more important than any tool.

---

**Q6: "Will you treat me differently if I say no?"**

**A**: Absolutely not. I've worked without MAIA for years, and I'm good at my job. MAIA is an enhancement, not a necessity. If you decline, we'll do great work together using my training, supervision, and intuition—same as always.

There's no penalty, no change in how I see you, no "you're missing out." Your comfort and safety come first.

---

**Q7: "How does this help me, specifically?"**

**A**: Honest answer: MAIA helps *me* be better at helping you.

Specifically:
- I notice patterns faster (so we don't spend months wandering)
- I catch things I might miss (like when you're dissociating and I don't realize it)
- I get suggestions from 19 different therapy approaches (so I can offer what fits YOU, not just what I know best)
- I see my own blind spots (so my stuff doesn't get in the way of your growth)

Does it guarantee better outcomes? No. But it's like... a surgeon using better imaging tech. Doesn't guarantee surgery succeeds, but it helps them see more clearly.

---

**Q8: "Can I see what MAIA says about me?"**

**A**: That's a great question. The short answer is: MAIA's reports are clinical notes—they're for *my* learning, not necessarily for sharing with you.

BUT: If there's something in a report that would be useful for you to know, I'd absolutely share it. Or if you're curious about your own process, I can explain what MAIA noticed in terms that make sense to you.

Would you want to see the raw report? We can discuss that. Some clients find it fascinating; others find it technical and not helpful. I'm open to figuring out what works for you.

---

**Q9: "What if I want you to delete everything MAIA has on me?"**

**A**: You can request that, and I'll honor it. I'll delete the recordings and any MAIA-generated reports from our sessions.

Just know: That's part of your clinical record, so if you want it deleted, I need to document why (usually "client request for privacy" is sufficient).

Also, if we're mid-treatment and you decide you want MAIA deleted, that's fine—we just move forward without it.

---

**Q10: "Is this just about you making more money?"**

**A**: I appreciate the direct question. Here's the honest answer:

MAIA is a tool I pay for (subscription fee), so it actually *costs* me money to use it. I'm not charging you extra for MAIA—your rate stays the same whether I use it or not.

I use it because I genuinely think it makes me better at my work. If you think it's about profit, I understand the skepticism. I can only tell you my motivation is to serve you better, not to monetize you.

**INFORMED CONSENT FOR USE OF MAIA (AI-ASSISTED CLINICAL SUPERVISION)**

**Client Name**: ___________________________________
**Therapist Name**: ________________________________
**Date**: _________________________________________

### What Is MAIA?

MAIA (Morphic Alchemical Intelligence Augmentation) is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that assists therapists with clinical supervision. It analyzes session recordings to identify patterns, suggest therapeutic frameworks, and provide feedback to help therapists improve their practice.

### How MAIA Works

**Post-Session Analysis**:
After our session, I may upload an audio recording to MAIA. The system transcribes the recording and generates a supervision report for me. This report includes:
- Patterns in your processing (e.g., emotional states, stages of change)
- Suggestions for therapeutic approaches that might help
- Feedback on my clinical interventions

**Real-Time Support** (optional):
During some sessions, I may use MAIA's real-time dashboard on my laptop. This provides live feedback on your nervous system state, emotional tone, and significant moments. You will not see this screen, and it is used only to inform my in-session decisions.

### Privacy & Security

- **Encryption**: All recordings are encrypted (scrambled) so only I can access them.
- **Storage**: Recordings are stored on HIPAA-compliant servers (meeting federal health privacy standards).
- **Access**: Only I (your therapist) have access to your MAIA data. MAIA staff do not view your sessions.
- **Data Use**: Your data is used solely for your treatment and my supervision. It is not sold, shared, or used for any other purpose.
- **Retention**: Recordings are kept for [SPECIFY: e.g., "3 months after session" or "duration of treatment + 7 years per state law"].

### Your Rights

**You have the right to**:
- **Decline**: You may decline the use of MAIA without affecting your treatment quality or our therapeutic relationship.
- **Withdraw Consent**: You may change your mind at any time and request that I stop using MAIA with your sessions.
- **Request Deletion**: You may request deletion of MAIA recordings and reports from your file (subject to legal record-keeping requirements).
- **Ask Questions**: You may ask me any questions about MAIA at any time.

### Limitations & Risks

- **Not a Substitute for Human Judgment**: MAIA is a tool that supports my clinical judgment. It does not replace my training, supervision, or decision-making.
- **Potential Errors**: MAIA may make errors in its analysis. I use it as one source of information, not the only source.
- **Technology Risks**: While rare, there is a small risk of data breach (as with any digital health record system). We use industry-standard security measures to minimize this risk.

### Subpoenas & Legal Requests

In rare cases, your therapy records—including MAIA data—could be subject to legal subpoena (court order). I will advocate for your privacy to the fullest extent of the law, but I cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality if a court requires disclosure.

### Consent

**I have read and understand this consent form.** I have had the opportunity to ask questions, and my questions have been answered to my satisfaction.

☐ **I consent** to the use of MAIA (AI-assisted supervision) in my therapy.

☐ **I do not consent** to the use of MAIA. I understand this does not affect my treatment.

### Diagram 2: What MAIA Sees vs. What It Doesn't

**MAIA DOES analyze**:
✓ Patterns in conversation
✓ Emotional tone
✓ Stages of processing
✓ Nervous system states (from voice)

**MAIA DOES NOT**:
✗ Judge you as "good" or "bad"
✗ Share your info with anyone
✗ Replace your therapist
✗ Make decisions about your treatment

### Handout: "MAIA in Plain English"

**One-page client handout**:

---

**WHAT IS MAIA?**

MAIA is an AI tool your therapist uses to get better at helping you. It's like having a smart colleague review sessions and give feedback.

**HOW IT WORKS**:
- Your therapist records sessions (with your permission)
- MAIA analyzes patterns (like: "Client is more regulated today")
- MAIA suggests ideas ("Try this therapy approach")
- Your therapist uses these ideas to help you

**YOUR PRIVACY**:
- Recordings are encrypted (locked)
- Only your therapist can access them
- MAIA doesn't share your information
- Same privacy as any therapy notes

**YOUR CHOICE**:
- You can say NO—your therapy won't change
- You can change your mind later
- You can ask questions anytime

**QUESTIONS? ASK YOUR THERAPIST.**

---

## Handling Client Concerns

### Concern 1: "I don't trust AI"

**Validate**: "I completely understand. There's a lot of justified skepticism about AI, especially with privacy concerns in the news."

**Explore**: "What specifically worries you about it? Is it privacy? Accuracy? Something else?"

**Respond**:
- If privacy: Explain encryption, HIPAA compliance, your control over data
- If accuracy: Explain MAIA is tool, you're still therapist, you override when needed
- If philosophical: "You know, some of my clients feel the same way. If it doesn't sit right with you, we don't have to use it. Your trust in me and in this space is more important."

**Offer**: "How about this—we can do a trial. Try it for 3 sessions, and if you don't like it, we stop. No pressure either way."

---

### Concern 2: "I don't want to be recorded"

**Validate**: "That makes sense. Being recorded can feel vulnerable, especially in therapy."

**Explore**: "Is it the recording itself that feels uncomfortable? Or worry about who might hear it?"

**Clarify**: "Just to be clear—only I hear the recording. MAIA transcribes it to text, and the analysis is based on text, not audio. But I understand that doesn't necessarily change the feeling of being recorded."

**Offer**: "We can try post-session summaries instead—I take notes right after our session, and MAIA analyzes my notes rather than a recording. Or we just don't use MAIA at all. What feels better to you?"

---

### Concern 3: "Will this make therapy feel less personal?"

**Validate**: "I appreciate you bringing that up. Therapy is deeply personal, and I don't want anything to interfere with that."

**Reassure**: "Here's my promise: If MAIA ever makes our work feel less personal or if I seem distracted by technology, tell me immediately, and we'll stop using it. Your experience in this room is what matters."

**Example**: "I've been using MAIA for [X time], and most clients say they don't even notice. I glance at the dashboard the way I might glance at the clock—just a quick check, then right back to you. But if you do notice, or if it bothers you, we adjust."

---

### Concern 4: "What if my data gets hacked?"

**Validate**: "That's a really important question. Data breaches happen, and it's smart to ask about security."

**Honest Answer**: "I can't guarantee zero risk—no one can, with any digital system. But here's what we do:
- Your data is encrypted (hackers would see gibberish, not your words)
- MAIA uses HIPAA-compliant servers (same standard as hospitals)
- I use strong passwords, two-factor authentication
- If there ever were a breach, I'd notify you immediately (legally required)

The risk is similar to using email or telehealth—small, but not zero. You decide if that's acceptable to you."

**Offer**: "If you prefer, I can take handwritten notes and not record sessions at all. Old-school, but totally secure."

---

### Concern 5: "I feel like I'm being watched"

**Validate**: "That feeling makes sense. Even though it's not like surveillance, it can feel like there's a third presence in the room."

**Normalize**: "Some clients describe it that way at first. Usually, after a couple sessions, they forget about it. But if that feeling persists for you, it's a problem—therapy should feel safe, not watched."

**Reframe** (if appropriate): "Some clients actually like the idea that there's more eyes on their process—like they're being held more carefully. But that's only if it feels that way for you."

**Offer**: "Let's try a session without MAIA and see how that feels. We can compare."

---

### Concern 6: Client says "Yes" but seems hesitant

**Check in**: "I notice you said yes, but I'm sensing some hesitation. Is there a part of you that's uncertain?"

**[Client expresses concern]**

**Validate & Explore**: "It's okay to feel ambivalent. You don't have to decide right now. We can start without MAIA and revisit this later if you're curious."

**Avoid pressure**: Don't push. If they're hesitant, default to NO until they're genuinely comfortable.

---

## Special Populations

### Children & Adolescents

**Additional considerations**:
- **Parent/guardian consent required** (in addition to child assent)
- **Age-appropriate language**: "It's like a robot helper that helps me be a better counselor"
- **Emphasis on privacy**: "Your parents won't see the recording—only I will"

**Script for children (8-12)**:

"Hey [name], I want to tell you about something. When we talk, I sometimes record our conversations—kind of like how you might record a video on your phone. I use a computer program called MAIA that listens to the recording and tells me things like 'Hey, [child] seemed really sad today' or '[Child] is feeling better than last week.'

It helps me understand how you're doing so I can help you better. Your parents won't hear the recording—only me. And if you don't like the idea, we don't have to do it. What do you think?"

---

### Trauma Survivors

**Additional considerations**:
- **Control & agency paramount**: Emphasize their choice, ability to revoke
- **Triggering content**: Clarify recordings are reviewed ONLY by you (not MAIA developers)
- **Reassure safety**: "This doesn't put you at risk. No one dangerous will ever have access."

**Be extra clear**:
- "You have complete control. You can say no, you can change your mind, you can ask me to delete everything."
- "This tool is for MY learning, not for you to be studied or judged."

---

### Highly Anxious Clients

**Additional considerations**:
- **Don't overwhelm**: Keep explanation brief, offer to answer questions over time
- **Written materials**: Give them handout to read between sessions
- **Slow rollout**: Start with post-session only (not real-time), then add later if comfortable

---

### Psychosis / Paranoia

**Recommendation**: **Do NOT use MAIA** with clients experiencing active paranoia or psychosis.

**Why**: "AI analyzing me" can feed delusions or paranoia. Wait until stabilized.

If they ask: "I don't use any recording technology with you because I want you to feel completely safe. No recordings, no AI, just you and me."

---

## Documentation

### What to Document in Client File

1. **Consent conversation**:
   - Date consent discussed
   - Client's questions and your responses
   - Client's decision (yes or no)

2. **Signed consent form** (if using)

3. **Any concerns client raised** and how you addressed them

4. **If client declines**:
   - "Client declined use of MAIA on [date]. Reason: [e.g., privacy concerns]. No impact on treatment."

5. **If client revokes consent later**:
   - "Client revoked MAIA consent on [date]. Deleted recordings and reports as of [date]."

### SOAP Note Example

**S (Subjective)**: Client expressed concern about MAIA ("I don't like the idea of being recorded"). Discussed privacy protections, encryption, and client's right to decline. Client ultimately agreed to trial for 3 sessions.

**O (Objective)**: Informed consent form signed. Copy provided to client.

**A (Assessment)**: Client appears cautiously open to technology-assisted supervision. Will monitor for any negative impact on therapeutic relationship.

**P (Plan)**: Use MAIA for next 3 sessions. Check in at session 4 about client's comfort level. Prepared to discontinue if client requests or if I observe interference with therapeutic alliance.

---

## Conclusion

**Key Takeaways for Practitioners**:

✅ **Be transparent**: Explain MAIA honestly, without minimizing or overselling

✅ **Offer choice**: Clients must genuinely feel they can say no

✅ **Answer questions**: Don't rush. Let them process, ask, express concerns

✅ **Respect refusal**: If client declines, honor it without judgment

✅ **Document thoroughly**: Consent conversation, decision, any concerns

✅ **Check in**: Even if client consents, periodically ask how it feels

**Remember**: The therapeutic relationship is primary. If MAIA interferes with client feeling safe, MAIA goes, relationship stays.

🜂 ∴ 🌀 ∴ 🧠

**Client consent serves both ethics and effectiveness. When clients understand and freely choose, MAIA enhances the work. When they don't, presence alone is enough.**
