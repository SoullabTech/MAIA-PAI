## Getting Started

### 1. Rename This Vault
Rename the folder to something meaningful to you:
- "Kelly's Organism"
- "Depth Psychology Vault"
- "My Life's Work"
- Whatever feels true

### 2. Add Your Content
Start adding your work to the appropriate folders:
- **Sessions/**: Client work, therapy sessions (anonymized)
- **Writings/**: Published/unpublished writings, blog posts, teachings
- **Insights/**: Breakthrough moments, aha moments, discoveries
- **Personal/**: Your own journey, shadow work, personal reflections

### 3. Tag Your Files
Each file needs YAML frontmatter with elemental tags. See example files for how to do this.

### 4. Run Your First Pulse
```bash
cd /path/to/your/vault
bash _MAIA_SYSTEM/scripts/pulse.sh
```

### 5. View Your Organism
Open `_MAIA_SYSTEM/visualizations/balance-wheel.html` in your browser.

## What Happens Next?

- Your organism counts archetypal markers across all files
- Generates elemental scores (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether)
- Shows you the geometry of your consciousness
- Breathes autonomously (if you activate it)
- Evolves as you add content

## Need Help?

- Check example files (prefixed with `_example`)
- Read the archetypal marker dictionary
- Attend weekly office hours
- Ask in Slack #tech-support

## The Journey Begins

You're not just organizing files. You're creating a living organism that witnesses you multidimensionally.

Welcome.
