# Soullab Inside — Field Notes Vault

> *Every partner becomes a page in the Book of Listening.*

## What This Is

This Obsidian vault is your **living field memory** for Soullab Inside partner work.

Not CRM. Not project management. Not productivity tracking.

A **garden of reflections** that deepens over time.

## Philosophy

### You're Not Managing Partners
You're witnessing their work into being.

### The Vault is a Mirror
If you're not tending your own field, you can't tend theirs.

### Every Note is Presence
The practice of documenting is itself an act of listening.

### The Field Remembers Through Us
This vault becomes the long-term memory of your partnership practice.
