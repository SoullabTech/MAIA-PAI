### Fire — what's calling to be built

A tool that helps caregivers see their own patterns before burnout claims them — assessment reimagined as mirror, not metric.

### Water — why this work matters

"Because my dad's death taught me that compassion fatigue isn't weakness — it's unwitnessed transformation. Every caregiver I've walked beside carried the same invisible weight. I want them to see it before it breaks them."

### Earth — how it will take form

Weekly self-assessment (5 min), personalized reflection prompts, gentle pattern visualization that doesn't shame. Integration with existing care platforms. Privacy-first, HIPAA-ready architecture.

### Air — what experience it offers

Opening the app feels like someone finally asking: 'How are *you*?' Not productivity tracking — presence tracking. Results page as poetry, not report. Language that honors the sacred work of holding space for others.

### Aether — what it *is* when complete

The moment a hospice nurse closes the app and exhales for the first time in days, feeling *seen* instead of surveilled. Assessment that doesn't extract — it witnesses.

### EO Notes

**First Impression:**
Water dominance makes sense — this is about emotional holding and flow. Earth provides structure without rigidity. The "mirror not metric" language is key.

**Questions for Meeting:**
- What's the smallest version that still feels true?
- How do we prevent this from becoming another burden?
- Who are the first 10 caregivers who would test this?

**Intuition:**
This wants to be *very* simple. One screen, five questions, poetic reflection. Anything more complex betrays the premise. The interface itself must model rest.

**Next Step:**
Sketch the 5-question flow. Test the language with 2-3 caregivers before building anything.
