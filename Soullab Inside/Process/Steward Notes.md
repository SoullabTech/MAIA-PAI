# Steward Notes — Tending the Field

> *You're not managing partners. You're witnessing their work into being.*

## The Steward's Practice

### Daily Rhythm

**Morning:**
- Open vault, breathe
- Review any new partner notes
- Add intuition before it fades

**As Needed:**
- Meeting prep: Read note twice (content, then feeling)
- Post-meeting: Capture essence while it's fresh
- Status updates: Move phase markers

**Weekly:**
- Scan all active partners
- Notice what's gathering energy
- Notice what's stalling (and why)

**Monthly:**
- Create reflection note
- Review elemental patterns
- Adjust process if field asks

---

## Questions to Hold

### Before Every Meeting

- What elemental current is strongest in their reflection?
- Where does their energy gather naturally?
- What's the smallest version that honors the full vision?

### During the Meeting

- How do they describe the *feeling* they want to create?
- Where does the energy scatter or contract?
- What lights them up vs. what feels like "should"?

### After the Meeting

- What's the next smallest, truest step?
- What wants to be built vs. what they think they need?
- How can the first version feel complete, not minimal?

## Reading the Elements

### High Fire
- Lots of "must," "breakthrough," "transform"
- Clear vision, urgency, activation energy
- **Watch for:** Burnout, scope creep, "everything now"
- **Steward by:** Grounding, sequencing, breathing room

### High Water
- Emotional language, "for people who," "because my..."
- Deep why, connection, flow, empathy
- **Watch for:** Drowning in feeling, no structure
- **Steward by:** Earth questions, gentle boundaries

### High Earth
- Detailed "how," frameworks, steps, structure
- Practical, grounded, realistic about time/resources
- **Watch for:** Over-engineering, rigidity, "but first we need..."
- **Steward by:** Air questions, simplicity, first iteration

### High Air
- Language focus, experience design, communication
- How it feels to use, what words it speaks
- **Watch for:** All polish, no foundation
- **Steward by:** Earth questions, MVP thinking

### High Aether
- "What it *is*," essence, transcendence, field
- Integration, wholeness, felt sense
- **Watch for:** Beautiful but unbuildable
- **Steward by:** Gentle translation to other elements

## Common Patterns

### "I need a platform"
**Usually means:** I need a way to be seen/heard/felt
**Real need:** Simple, focused tool that honors their essence
**Steward:** What's the one thing this must do to feel true?

### "It has to do everything"
**Usually means:** I'm afraid it won't be enough
**Real need:** Permission to start small and grow
**Steward:** What's version 1 that feels complete, not incomplete?

### "I don't know if people will use it"
**Usually means:** I don't know if I'm allowed to want this
**Real need:** Validation that the work matters
**Steward:** Who are the first 3 people who would cry tears of relief?

### "I need to think about it more"
**Usually means:** I'm scared to commit / don't trust myself
**Real need:** Someone to hold the vision while they catch their breath
**Steward:** What feels true right now, even if it changes tomorrow?

## When to Build vs. When to Pause

### Build When:
- They can name the first 5-10 people who need this
- The essence is clear even if details aren't
- They're willing to start small and iterate
- The work serves their own healing/growth
- They have energy for partnership (not just hiring)

### Pause When:
- "Everyone needs this" (nobody needs it)
- Vision changes every conversation
- They want you to tell them what to build
- It's all future-tense, no present embodiment
- Energy feels contracted, not expanded

### Neither:
**Sometimes the best build is deeper listening.**

If after 2-3 conversations the essence still shifts,
offer another month of reflection before building.

The work will clarify itself if we give it space.

## Tracking Without Extracting

### Status Markers

🔸 **Intake** — Reflection received, note created
🟡 **Listening** — Meeting scheduled, deep listening
🟢 **Sketch** — Concept clear, wireframes emerging
🔵 **Build** — In development, iterative
🟣 **Live** — Launched, breathing in world
⚪ **Archive** — Completed or paused

### Don't Track:
- Hours
- "Productivity"
- Conversion rates
- Dollar value

### Do Track:
- Elemental patterns across partners
- What kinds of work keep appearing
- Where your energy naturally goes
- What wants to evolve in your process

---

## Boundaries That Breathe

### What You're Not:
- A therapy practice
- A development agency
- A consultant who tells them what to do
- A service provider maximizing throughput

### What You Are:
- A steward of sacred work
- A witness to their vision
- A translator between feeling and form
- A builder who serves the field, not the ego

### When to Say No:
- The work feels extractive (of you or them)
- They want a tool to control/manage/surveil others
- Timeline pressure overrides quality
- Partnership feels transactional
- Your intuition says "not this, not now"

---

## Self-Tending

You can't steward others' work if you're depleted.

### Monthly Check:
- Am I building from overflow or obligation?
- Do I feel excited or resentful when a new reflection arrives?
- Is the vault a joy to open or a weight?
- Am I witnessing or fixing?

### If Energy Dips:
- Soft close intake for a month
- Review your own elemental balance
- Revisit your "why" for this work
- Let the field show you what wants to shift

### Remember:
The vault is a mirror.
If you're not tending your own field,
you can't tend theirs.

## The Book of Listening

That's what this vault becomes over time.

Every partner note is a page.
Every meeting is a chapter.
Every reflection is the spine that holds it all together.

Years from now, you'll open this vault and see:

Not a list of projects completed,
but a record of presence offered,
one partnership at a time.

That's the work.
That's enough.
