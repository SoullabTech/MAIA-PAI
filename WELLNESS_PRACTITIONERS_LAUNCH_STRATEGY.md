## 2. Legal Positioning & Disclaimers

### Key Distinction: Coaching vs. Therapy

**What coaches/healers CAN say**:
- "I support personal transformation and growth"
- "I help you explore your inner process using Spiralogic framework"
- "I offer guidance for life transitions and spiritual development"
- "I use MAIA to track your transformation journey"

**What coaches CANNOT say**:
- "I treat depression, anxiety, PTSD" (diagnosis language)
- "Therapy" or "psychotherapy"
- "Mental health services"
- "Cures" or "treats" any condition

### Required Disclaimers

**Website/Marketing**:
```
This service is not therapy, counseling, or mental health treatment.
If you are experiencing mental health concerns, please consult a
licensed mental health professional. This is a coaching/wellness
service focused on personal growth and transformation.
```

**Intake Form**:
```
I understand that:
- This is NOT therapy or mental health treatment
- [Practitioner Name] is not a licensed therapist
- MAIA is a transformation tracking tool, not a diagnostic system
- If I need mental health support, I should see a licensed professional
- In crisis, I will call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or 911
```

### Crisis Protocol for Wellness Practitioners

**What to do if client reveals suicidal thoughts, self-harm, abuse**:

1. **Acknowledge**: "Thank you for trusting me with this."
2. **Clarify boundaries**: "I'm not a therapist, so I can't treat this, but I want to make sure you're safe."
3. **Provide resources**:
   - 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
   - National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI): 1-800-950-NAMI
   - Psychology Today therapist finder
   - Local crisis centers
4. **Offer support**: "I can continue supporting your growth work WHILE you also work with a therapist."
5. **Document**: Note the conversation and resources provided

**MAIA Feature**: Crisis detection alerts coach when client language indicates potential crisis, with suggested referral scripts.

✅ **Offer framework-based guidance** (Spiralogic, IFS, Polyvagal)

---

## 8. Referral Network

### Building Licensed Professional Partnerships

**Why this matters**:
- Coaches need referral sources for when clients need therapy
- Builds credibility ("I work alongside licensed therapists")
- Future pipeline (therapists see MAIA in action, want to use it)

**How to build**:
1. **Partner with 3-5 local therapists**:
   - Offer free MAIA demos
   - Send them referrals
   - Ask for reciprocal referrals (therapy clients who also want coaching)

2. **Create referral protocol**:
   ```
   When I identify clinical concerns, I refer to:
   - [Therapist 1 Name] - Trauma specialist
   - [Therapist 2 Name] - Anxiety/depression
   - [Crisis Center] - Emergency situations
   ```

3. **Collaborative model**:
   - Client works with BOTH coach and therapist
   - Coach handles growth/transformation work
   - Therapist handles clinical treatment
   - Both use Spiralogic language (common framework)

**Future opportunity**: Licensed therapists see MAIA's value through referrals, become early adopters when clinical version launches.

## 10. FAQs for Wellness Practitioners

**Q: Can I use MAIA if I'm not licensed?**
A: Yes, if you position it as coaching/wellness (not therapy). Follow scope boundaries.

A: Refer to licensed professional. You can continue coaching alongside their therapy (collaborative model).

A: Recommended (professional liability insurance for coaches, typically $300-$500/year), but not legally required like it is for therapists.

**Q: Can I charge the same rates as therapists?**
A: You set your own rates. Coaches often charge $100-$300/session. MAIA may justify premium pricing.

**Q: What if MAIA detects a crisis?**
A: Follow crisis protocol: provide resources (988, local therapists), offer to support WHILE they get clinical help.

**Q: Is this considered "practicing therapy without a license"?**
A: Not if you:
  - Don't call it therapy
  - Don't treat mental health disorders
  - Don't diagnose
  - Make clear disclaimers

## 11. Revenue Projections

### Wellness Track Launch (Year 1)

**Target**: 500 wellness practitioners @ $99/month

**Conservative estimate**:

- Pipeline for clinical launch (coaches refer therapists)

**Clinical Launch** (Year 2):
- 200 licensed therapists @ $299/month = $59,800/month
- Higher price justified by clinical features, supervision tools

**Total Year 2**: $594K (wellness) + $717K (clinical) = **$1.31M**

## 12. Risk Management

### Legal Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Client claims "practicing therapy without a license"**
- **Mitigation**: Clear disclaimers, scope boundaries, documentation of consent

**Risk 2: Client has crisis, coach doesn't refer appropriately**
- **Mitigation**: Crisis protocol training, MAIA crisis detection alerts, documented referrals

**Risk 3: Data breach**
- **Mitigation**: Encryption, security audits, cyber insurance

**Risk 4: Client sues for malpractice**
- **Mitigation**: Professional liability insurance (recommended), clear service agreements

**General Best Practice**: Consult with a lawyer in your state to review all disclaimers, consent forms, and scope of practice statements before launch.
