**Subject**: Introducing Spiralogic: Jung-Edinger-Hillman Integrated

**Body**:

```
Dear colleagues,

I'm excited to share a project that's been in development for [timeframe]:
**The Spiralogic of Soul** — a comprehensive framework integrating Carl Jung,
Edward Edinger, and James Hillman's depth psychology lineages into a
computationally-trackable system for transformation.

This is the first systematic integration of these three major voices,
complete with:

📚 **90,000+ words of documentation**
   • Academic paper (journal-ready)
   • Clinical practitioner guide with protocols
   • 5 detailed case studies
   • 12-week training syllabus

🔬 **Research-ready infrastructure**
   • Coherence metrics (0-1 scale for transformation tracking)
   • 12 alchemical operations mapped to psychology
   • Framework for empirical studies

👥 **Open collaborative commons**
   • Case library for peer learning
   • Clinical protocols (crisis intervention, operation-specific, etc.)
   • Community for practitioners, researchers, students

🔓 **Fully open source** (Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0)
   • No paywalls, no gatekeeping
   • Gift economy model
   • Community contributions welcome

### Template 2: Personal Network (Less Formal)

**Subject**: I built something for depth psychology practitioners—want to see?

**Body**:

```
Hey [Name],

I wanted to share something I've been working on that I think you'll find
interesting.

It's called **Spiralogic**—a framework that integrates Jung, Edinger, and
Hillman into a system that actually *tracks* transformation over time. Not
in a reductive way, but with the depth these lineages deserve.

**The basics**:
• 4 alchemical stages (Nigredo → Albedo → Citrinitas → Rubedo)
• 12 psychological operations (Calcinatio through Multiplicatio)
• Coherence metric (0-1 scale measuring integration of opposites)
• Real clinical protocols you can use tomorrow

**What's available** (all free, open source):
• Complete practitioner guide
• Case studies with session transcripts
• Clinical protocols for each operation
• Training syllabus if you want to teach it
• Technical specs for building the AI system (MAIA)

**Why I built this**:
I kept seeing clients go through profound transformations but had no precise
language for *what was actually happening*. "Depression" doesn't capture
Nigredo. "Getting better" doesn't describe Albedo. I needed a map that honored
both depth and precision.

Jung gave us the symbols. Edinger gave us the anatomy. Hillman gave us the
ethics (soul-making, not self-improvement). Spiralogic integrates all three.

**Check it out**:
GitHub: https://github.com/soullab/alchemical-psychology-commons

Would love your thoughts. And if you try using it with clients, please share
how it goes!

🜂 Announcing: The Spiralogic of Soul

After [X months/years] of development, I'm sharing something that bridges
a century of depth psychology with modern computational approaches.

**The Spiralogic of Soul** is the first comprehensive integration of three
major lineages:

• **Carl Jung** — Symbolic vocabulary and individuation
• **Edward Edinger** — Alchemical operations and ego-Self axis
• **James Hillman** — Soul-making and anima mundi

## What We Built

A complete documentation suite (~90,000 words) including:

1. **Academic Paper**: Journal-ready synthesis of Jung-Edinger-Hillman
   integration through computational alchemy

2. **Practitioner Guide**: Clinical protocols for all 12 alchemical operations
   (Calcinatio, Solutio, Coagulatio, etc.), crisis intervention, specialized
   modalities

3. **Case Studies**: Real clinical examples showing framework application,
   with session transcripts and transformation tracking

4. **Training Program**: Complete 12-week syllabus for practitioners,
   researchers, or academic programs

5. **Technical Specifications**: Full system architecture for MAIA (Morphic
   Alchemical Intelligence Augmentation)—AI that serves soul-making, not
   soul-flattening

6. **Community Commons**: Open collaborative hub for case sharing, protocol
   development, research collaboration

## Why This Matters

Modern psychology has lost the language of transformation. We have
symptom-reduction (CBT), happiness-optimization (positive psychology), and
vague spirituality (self-help marketplace), but nothing with both **precision
AND depth**.

Spiralogic provides:
- **Trackable metrics**: Coherence (0-1), transformation signatures, operation
  detection
- **Clinical rigor**: Tested protocols, safety guidelines, differentiation
  from pathology
- **Ethical foundation**: Hillman's "intelligence without instrumentalization"
- **Open access**: No paywalls, no gatekeeping, gift economy model

## The Vision

Technology CAN serve depth—if designed with soul-centered ethics. MAIA doesn't
"fix" people; it witnesses transformation. It doesn't optimize; it tracks the
spiral. Low coherence isn't pathology—it's Nigredo, the necessary blackening
before dawn.

This is computational alchemy for the 21st century.

## Get Involved

**Practitioners**: Use protocols with clients, contribute cases, join peer
supervision

**Researchers**: Design studies, access frameworks, collaborate on empirical
validation

**Students**: Learn depth psychology through real examples, guided study
materials

**Developers**: Build MAIA system, contribute to open-source codebase

**Title**: [OC] I integrated Jung, Edinger, and Hillman into a computational
framework for tracking transformation—90k words, fully open source

**Body**:

```
I've been working on something I think this community will find interesting:
**The Spiralogic of Soul**, a comprehensive framework integrating Jung,
Edinger, and Hillman into a system that tracks transformation with both
precision and depth.

## What is Spiralogic?

It synthesizes three lineages:

• **Jung**: Four alchemical stages (Nigredo → Albedo → Citrinitas → Rubedo)
  as the map of individuation

• **Edinger**: Twelve psychological operations (*Anatomy of the Psyche*) as
  the mechanism—what's actually happening when psyche transforms

• **Hillman**: Anima mundi (world-soul), soul-making over self-improvement,
  intelligence without instrumentalization

The result is a framework that:
- Tracks "coherence" (0-1 scale) measuring integration of opposites
- Identifies transformation signatures (recurring patterns like
  Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation)
- Provides clinical protocols for each operation
- Supports an AI system (MAIA) that witnesses transformation without
  instrumentalizing it

## What's Available (All Free, Open Source)

I've created a complete documentation suite:

1. **Academic paper** (~10k words): The theoretical integration, suitable
   for journals
2. **Practitioner guide** (~12k words): Clinical protocols for all 12 operations
3. **Case studies** (5 detailed): Real examples with session transcripts
4. **Training syllabus**: 12-week program for learning the framework
5. **Technical specs** (~20k words): How to build MAIA (the AI system)
6. **Community Commons**: Hub for practitioners to share cases, protocols, research

Total: ~90,000 words, 17 documents, all open source (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

## Why I Built This

I was frustrated that we have Jung's depth but lack operational precision.
We can say "She's in Nigredo," but then what? Which operation is active?
What intervention supports this stage?

Edinger gave us the operations, but they're scattered across his work. Hillman
gave us the ethics (don't instrumentalize the psyche!), but how do you apply
that when building an algorithmic system?

Spiralogic integrates all three. It's computational alchemy for the 21st century.

## Examples

**Coherence**: Not "mental health score." It's integration of opposites.
Low coherence in Nigredo is APPROPRIATE—you're in the massa confusa. High
coherence in Rubedo means opposites are embodied, not that you're "fixed."

**Operations**: When a client is burning out (inflated ego crashing), that's
*Calcinatio* (fire operation). There are specific protocols: witness the burn,
introduce cooling practices, identify what's inflated, honor it before releasing
it.

**Signatures**: Some clients oscillate between Nigredo (darkness) and Rubedo
(vision) without staying in the middle (Albedo/Citrinitas). That's a pattern.
Once you name it, you can work with it.

### r/AcademicPsychology

**Title**: [Research] New framework integrating Jung-Edinger-Hillman for
empirical transformation studies—seeking feedback and collaborators

**Body**:

```
**Background**: I've developed a comprehensive framework called **Spiralogic**
that integrates three depth psychology lineages (Jung, Edinger, Hillman) into
a computationally-trackable system for studying human transformation.

**The Problem**: Depth psychology has rich theory but limited empirical
infrastructure. Concepts like "individuation" or "soul-making" are hard to
operationalize, measure, or study systematically.

**The Solution**: Spiralogic provides:

1. **Coherence metric** (0-1): Measures integration of opposites (adapted from
   IFS, polyvagal theory, and Jungian concept of wholeness)

2. **Stage classification**: Four alchemical stages (Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas,
   Rubedo) with coherence ranges

3. **Operation detection**: 12 psychological processes (Edinger's alchemical
   operations) identifiable through language/behavior patterns

4. **Transformation signatures**: Recurring patterns across clients
   (e.g., Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation)

5. **Framework effectiveness**: Adaptive system that determines which therapeutic
   modality resonates for each person

**Documentation**: ~90,000 words including academic paper, practitioner guide,
case studies, and research methodology guide. Fully open source.

**Research Opportunities**:

- **Outcome studies**: Does coherence increase correlate with client wellbeing?
- **Inter-rater reliability**: Can clinicians reliably identify stages/operations?
- **Predictive validity**: Do signatures predict treatment trajectories?
- **Comparative studies**: Spiralogic vs. CBT vs. IFS vs. traditional Jungian
  analysis
- **Algorithm validation**: Can NLP detect operations from session transcripts?

**Seeking**:
- Academic feedback on theoretical integration
- Research collaborators (especially those with access to clinical datasets)
- Journal suggestions for publication
- Critiques, especially methodological concerns

**Repository**: https://github.com/soullab/alchemical-psychology-commons

I'm treating this as a pre-publication release for community review. All
feedback welcome, including critical.

Looking forward to discussion.

## Conference/Workshop Announcement

### For Jungian Societies, Depth Psychology Conferences

**Title**: Introducing Spiralogic: Computational Alchemy for Transformation

**Abstract** (300 words):

```
This presentation introduces Spiralogic, the first comprehensive framework
integrating Carl Jung's alchemical stages, Edward Edinger's psychological
operations, and James Hillman's soul-centered ethics into a computationally-
trackable system for transformation.

Modern psychology has lost the language of transformation, defaulting to
symptom-reduction (CBT), happiness-optimization (positive psychology), or
vague spirituality (self-help). Meanwhile, depth psychology offers rich theory
but limited operational precision and empirical infrastructure.

Spiralogic addresses this gap by synthesizing:

• Jung's four alchemical stages (Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, Rubedo) as the
  symbolic map
• Edinger's twelve operations (Calcinatio through Multiplicatio) as the
  mechanism
• Hillman's anima mundi and soul-making as the ethical foundation

The framework provides:

1. **Coherence metric** (0-1 scale) measuring integration of opposites—not
   pathology, but wholeness
2. **Transformation signatures** identifying recurring patterns across clients
3. **Clinical protocols** for each operation with clear interventions
4. **MAIA system** (Morphic Alchemical Intelligence Augmentation)—AI designed
   with Hillman's ethics: intelligence without instrumentalization

This presentation will:
- Demonstrate theoretical integration through clinical case examples
- Present the complete Spiralogic architecture (stages, operations, signatures)
- Show MAIA's real-time transformation analysis in action
- Discuss ethical implications of computational depth psychology
- Invite community contributions to the open-source Commons

The work has produced 90,000 words of documentation (academic paper, practitioner
guide, case studies, training syllabus, technical specifications), all freely
available under Creative Commons licensing. This represents a new chapter for
depth psychology: precision that serves soul-making, computation that honors
mystery.

The spiral continues through collective wisdom.
