Force redeploy trigger - ROOT PACKAGE.JSON FIXED
Timestamp: Fri Nov 15 16:55:00 EST 2025
Commit: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED
Status: VERCEL WAS READING WRONG PACKAGE.JSON

THE SMOKING GUN:
- Root /package.json had "next": "^15.5.6"
- apps/web/package.json had "next": "14.2.32"
- Vercel reads ROOT package.json first!!!
- Fixed root package.json to use "next": "14.2.32"

This was THE issue causing the persistent 15.5.6 usage.
NOW Vercel should finally use Next.js 14.2.32 correctly.
