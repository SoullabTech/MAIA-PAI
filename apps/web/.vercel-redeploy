Force redeploy trigger - STYLED-JSX VERSION ALIGNMENT
Timestamp: Fri Nov 15 17:00:00 EST 2025
Commit: PINNED STYLED-JSX TO EXACT VERSION
Status: STYLED-JSX VERSION CONFLICT RESOLVED

VERSION ALIGNMENT COMPLETED:
- Next.js 14.2.32 expects styled-jsx@5.1.1
- Fixed apps/web/package.json: "styled-jsx": "5.1.1" (was ^5.1.6)
- Added to root package.json: "styled-jsx": "5.1.1"
- Verified consistent resolution: both now use 5.1.1

This should resolve the "Cannot find module 'styled-jsx/style'" errors.
