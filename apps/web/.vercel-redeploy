Timestamp: Fri Nov 15 16:50:00 EST 2025
Commit: FORCING FRESH INSTALL IN VERCEL
Status: CACHE CLEARING DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

Aggressive cache clearing applied:
- Removed package-lock.json to force fresh resolution
- Updated vercel.json with aggressive cache clearing commands
- Forcing Next.js 14.2.32 installation without cache
- This MUST resolve the 15.5.6 vs 14.2.32 version conflict

Final attempt to end deployment nightmare.
