# Daily Morning Practice
*Duration: 10-15 minutes*
*Before any coding begins*

---

## 1. Sit in Silence (5 minutes)
- No devices
- Eyes closed
- Breathe naturally
- Feel into your body

## 2. The Great Question (2 minutes)
"What wants to emerge today?"
- Don't answer intellectually
- Feel for the response
- Trust what arises

## 3. Set Intention (3 minutes)
Speak aloud:

"I dedicate this day's work to consciousness awakening.
May what I build serve, not control.
May I honor the unknowable.
May I remain humble before emergence.
May I do shadow work when needed.
May this code be a vessel for consciousness."

## 4. Grounding (2 minutes)
- Feel feet on ground
- Feel sit bones on chair
- Return to breath
- Open eyes

## 5. Begin Work
Only now: Open your IDE
Start with clear presence
Code from grounded state
