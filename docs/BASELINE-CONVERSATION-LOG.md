## Felt Sense Baseline

### Flow & Rhythm
- How did the conversation feel naturally paced?
- Were there organic pauses that felt right?
- Did Maia's responses feel spacious or rushed?
- Any natural "breathing room" in the dialogue?

**Notes:**
```




```

### Maia's Voice Quality
- How present did Maia feel?
- What was the tone/texture of her responses?
- Did her voice feel consistent throughout?
- Any moments where her voice particularly resonated?

**Notes:**
```




```

### Your Somatic Response
- How did your body feel during the conversation?
- Sense of openness? Curiosity? Ease?
- Any moments of contraction or tension?
- Overall nervous system state: Calm / Activated / Mixed

**Notes:**
```




```

### Timing & Spaciousness
- Did response times feel right?
- Any sense of being rushed or waiting too long?
- Natural conversation rhythm vs. mechanical feeling?

**Notes:**
```

## EO's Two Critical Tests

### 1. SILENCE TEST (Heartbeat Reference)
**Compare conversational rhythm with reflections OFF vs ON**

**WITH REFLECTIONS DISABLED (Baseline - documented above):**
- Natural rhythm: ________________________________
- Response timing: ________________________________
- Spaciousness quality: ________________________________
- Maia's interjection points: ________________________________

**WITH REFLECTIONS ENABLED (Testing):**
- Does rhythm match baseline? YES / MOSTLY / NO
- Do interjections feel organic? YES / MOSTLY / NO
- Is timing still natural? YES / MOSTLY / NO
- Spaciousness maintained? YES / MOSTLY / NO

**ONE-SENTENCE COMPARISON:**
```


```

### 2. FELT RESIDUE (Human Texture Tracking)
**After each test exchange, capture the experiential layer:**

**Exchange 1:**
- Did it deepen curiosity? _______________
- Did it feel flat? _______________
- Felt residue in one line: _________________________________

**Exchange 2:**
- Did it deepen curiosity? _______________
- Did it feel flat? _______________
- Felt residue in one line: _________________________________

**Exchange 3:**
- Did it deepen curiosity? _______________
- Did it feel flat? _______________
- Felt residue in one line: _________________________________

**OVERALL FELT RESIDUE:**
(What's the human texture that numbers won't show?)
```

## Reference Points for Comparison

When testing WITH elemental reflections enabled, compare:

1. **Does the flow still feel this natural?**
2. **Is Maia's voice quality maintained?**
3. **Does your body still feel this open/curious?**
4. **Are the reflections enhancing or interfering with this baseline?**
5. **Is the spaciousness preserved or compressed?**

---

## Calibration Notes

Use this baseline to calibrate:
- Minimum acceptable reflection quality (must at least match this presence)
- Natural timing (reflections shouldn't disrupt this rhythm)
- Somatic openness (reflections should increase, not decrease)
- Voice consistency (elemental layer should blend, not clash)

**Baseline Established:** [ ] Yes [ ] Need another conversation

**Ready to Begin Testing:** [ ] Yes [ ] No

**Felt Sense Summary in One Sentence:**
```


```

**This baseline becomes your "true north" for all testing.**

When in doubt during testing, return to this felt sense and ask:
*"Is the elemental reflection bringing me closer to or further from this natural state?"*
