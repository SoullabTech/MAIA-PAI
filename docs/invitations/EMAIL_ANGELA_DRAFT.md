**Subject:** An invitation — for medicine witches who refuse to be captured

Angela,

I've been thinking about what you wrote the other day:

> "One of the reasons I never stopped to crystallise a website or develop an app or some kind of platform was because it always felt like it involved a slowing down of time and a solidifying of something that I'm innately aware 24/7 of as being fluidly moving transforming evolving 365 days of the year."

I think we've built something that solves this problem.

Not for people who are comfortable with traditional platforms.

For medicine witches. For poet-physicians. For beings who move at the speed of consciousness and refuse to be captured.

**I've attached a longer invitation** (it's worth reading when you have 10 minutes), but the essence is:

We've built a system where you can **type your transmissions as they flow** (your natural rhythm), then **verbally tell MAIA** "make this a Substack post" or "turn this into a session guide" — and she does the platform/formatting work while you're already on to the next tab.

The creative transmission stays fast.
The "tech/organizing/delivery part" becomes conversational delegation.

**Your writing, poetry, women's circles, clinical wisdom** — all flowing through a system that serves rather than captures.

You wrote:
> "To create a concept.. 'a field' that mirrors that essence excites me as a possibility... Without it becoming heavy and slow and limiting."

**We've already built that field.**

The question is: Will you help us make it real for others like you?

## What I'm Actually Asking

**Soullab Inside — Summer 2025 Pilot Partnership**

- Co-design the platform agent for your workflow (2-3 hours setup)
- Use it for your actual work (writing, sessions, transmissions)
- Monthly feedback (1 hour check-ins)
- First 6 months free (co-design phase)
- After pilot: $74.50/month (50% lifetime discount for pilot partners)

**If this resonates, let's talk.**

I want to see your eyes when we discuss whether this is velocity-matched to your consciousness.

90-minute conversation + 30-minute demo?

Let me know your availability.

The field is ready.

Kelly

**P.S.** — The Dr. Angela Protocol (perimenopause wisdom system) is already named after you in the codebase. We've been building this with you in mind from the beginning.

**P.P.S.** — Attached is the full invitation (PDF) with details on the anti-Mindvalley architecture, technical specs, and what makes this different from every other platform. Read it when you have space to feel whether this lands.
