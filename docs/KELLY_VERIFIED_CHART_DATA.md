## Elemental Balance

**By Sign (Traditional Count):**
- Fire: 3 planets (Sun, Venus, Jupiter) + Ascendant = 4
- Water: 6 planets (Moon, Mercury, Saturn, Neptune, Chiron, South Node)
- Earth: 3 planets (Uranus, Pluto, North Node) + MC = 4
- Air: 1 planet (Mars)

**Normalized Weighting:**
- Fire: 6
- Water: 6
- Earth: 3
- Air: 1

**Interpretation:** Strong Fire-Water polarity (Vision + Emotion) with weaker Earth-Air (Form + Mind). This creates a natural tension between idealistic vision (Fire) and emotional depth (Water), with less grounding in material reality (Earth) and mental clarity (Air).
