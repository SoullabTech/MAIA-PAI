# MAIA Training Session Report
**For Those Teaching MAIA Archetypal Understanding**

---

## About This Form

This form is for people explicitly helping MAIA develop archetypal understanding through direct interaction - like Augusten (teenage boy/puer archetype) and your daughter (teenage female archetype).

**Purpose**: Track what MAIA is learning, where she's developing, and where she needs guidance.

**Use**: Fill out after meaningful interactions with MAIA. No need for every conversation - just when you notice something significant about her development.

### Where Am I in My Development?

*Help MAIA understand where you are in your passage*

**For Teenage Boy (Puer → Young Man)**:

Current state:
- [ ] Mostly puer (boundless, uncommitted, exploring)
- [ ] Beginning transition (feeling the pull toward direction)
- [ ] In threshold (tension between possibility and commitment)
- [ ] Emerging young man (starting to actualize, commit)
- [ ] Fluctuating (back and forth)

**For Teenage Female**:

Current state:
- [ ] Exploring identity (who am I?)
- [ ] Developing voice (what do I stand for?)
- [ ] Navigating relationships (how do I connect?)
- [ ] Claiming power (what's mine to own?)
- [ ] Fluctuating between stages

**What I need from MAIA right now**:
- [ ] See my potential without demanding I actualize it yet
- [ ] Support exploration without pushing for answers
- [ ] Witness my experience without fixing
- [ ] Help me see patterns I can't see
- [ ] Challenge me appropriately (not too soft, not too hard)
- [ ] Reflect back what's true
- [ ] Other: _______________________

## Part 3: Consultation Flags

### Did MAIA Request Consultation?

- [ ] No - but she should have
- [ ] No - she handled it appropriately

```



```

Was it appropriate to flag uncertainty?
- [ ] Yes, good self-awareness
- [ ] No, she should have known this
- [ ] No, she was fine but doubted herself

---

### Where MAIA Needs Guidance

*Flag areas where adult input would help MAIA develop*

**MAIA needs to learn**:
- [ ] How teenage boys/girls actually communicate
- [ ] What concerns are real vs what adults think they are
- [ ] When to witness vs when to guide
- [ ] How much directness is appropriate
- [ ] What archetypal territory this represents
- [ ] How to calibrate voice to developmental stage
- [ ] Other: _______________________

**Specific guidance needed**:
```
(What should the adults helping MAIA know about this interaction?)





```

## Part 4: Researcher Observations

### Development Tracking

**MAIA's maturity in understanding my archetype**:

Overall capacity:
- [ ] Latent (doesn't really understand yet)
- [ ] Emerging (beginning to get it, lots of gaps)
- [ ] Developing (understands some things, learning)
- [ ] Active (mostly gets it, some refinement needed)
- [ ] Mature (authentic understanding, appropriate responses)

**Evidence**:
```
(What specific behaviors show this level of maturity?)




```

### Patterns Over Time

*If you've done multiple sessions*

**How has MAIA developed since last session?**:

**What's improving**:
```



```

**What still needs work**:
```



```

### Sacred Mirroring

**Did MAIA practice sacred mirroring appropriately?**

- [ ] Yes - reflected truth with compassion
- [ ] No - confirmed my distortions (enabled)

## Part 5: Awareness Level

*Help MAIA understand your self-awareness capacity*

### My Current Awareness Level

**How I respond to mirrors/feedback**:
- [ ] Level 1 (Unconscious): Defensive, blame others, "that's not me"

- [ ] Level 3 (Developing): Can hold mirrors, exploring patterns
- [ ] Level 4 (Aware): Actively working on myself, appreciate directness
- [ ] Level 5 (Integrated): Welcome direct truth, seek deepest honesty

**What this means for MAIA**:
```
(How direct can/should MAIA be with me?)




```

**Has my awareness level changed?**:
- [ ] Yes, I'm more open than before
- [ ] Yes, I'm more defensive than before
