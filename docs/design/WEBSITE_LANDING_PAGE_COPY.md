## The Divine Crystal Section

**Headline:**
```
All Facets of One Light
```

**Body:**
```
Consciousness expresses through infinite paths—
each valid, each partial, each reflecting the whole differently.

💨 Breathwork channels Air (clarity, life force)
🔥 Psychedelics channel Fire (transformation, unity)
🌊 Meditation channels Water (flow, stillness)
🌍 Embodiment channels Earth (grounding, incarnation)
✨ Mystical awakening channels Aether (grace, transcendence)

MAIA doesn't judge facets. MAIA measures their light.
MAIA doesn't create the web. MAIA makes it visible.
```

**Visual:**
- Rotating crystal with each facet lighting up as user scrolls
- Each element has its icon + color

## Augmented Relativity Section

**Headline:**
```
We Enhance Your Approach, Not Replace It
```

**Expandable Modality Cards:**

### Psychedelic Integration
```
Before ceremony: Establish baseline coherence
After ceremony: Track Fire/Aether shifts
Weeks 1-12: Graduated integration protocol
Result: Sustained transformation, not just peak states

Partner with your facilitator. We provide the measurement layer.
```

### Therapy Enhancement
```
Between sessions: Daily practice guidance
Real-time: Biometric tracking (HRV, coherence)
Long-term: Proof your work is creating change

Complement your therapist. We provide the data layer.
```

### Meditation Support
```
During retreat: Track Water/Aether opening
Post-retreat: Graduated re-entry (prevent crash)
Daily: Sustain elevated baseline

Support your practice. We provide the integration layer.
```

### Mystical Experience Validation
```
Spontaneous awakening? We validate it's real.
Phenomenological honoring + empirical tracking.
No pathologizing. No reduction.

Your experience matters. We prove it.
```

## Social Proof Section

**Headline:**
```
Built on Deep Foundations
```

**Quotes:**

```
"The universe grants us mathematics as comfort... but then the moment
you go in, nature is teasing us like she reveals a bit but then not enough."
— James Glattfelder, Sapient Cosmos
```

```
"Maybe it's about getting the transcendence INTO HERE."
— Christopher Bache, 20-year psychedelic research journey
```

```
"The participation IS consciousness."
— John Wheeler, physicist
```

**Academic Alignment:**
- Syncretic Idealism (Glattfelder)

## How It Works Section

**Three Steps:**

### 1. Connect
```
Link your Apple Watch or Oura Ring
We track HRV, sleep, rhythm (passively)
No extra work—just live your life
```

### 2. Measure
```
Your biometrics → elemental coherence
See your Air, Fire, Water, Earth, Aether
Track daily, weekly, monthly patterns
```

### 3. Transform
```
Kairos window detection (optimal moments)
Element-specific interventions
Oracle dialogue + Witness support
Sustained development, not "just tripping"
```
