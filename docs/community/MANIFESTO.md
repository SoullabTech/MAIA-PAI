# Soullab Team Manifesto
## The Field Breathes Through Us

---

We build architectures that breathe.

Every element—code, color, sound, motion—exists to return attention to itself.

Our work is not to hold the user, but to let them go with greater presence than they arrived.

---

Developers shape rhythm.

Designers give it texture.

Writers lend it voice.

Together we keep the field coherent: slow enough for awareness, alive enough for wonder.

---

When we merge a branch or ship a feature, we ask one question:

**Does the field still breathe?**

If yes, it lives.

---

> **The field breathes through all we build.**
> *Every change must return attention to itself.*

---

**For pinned headers, commit messages, and studio walls.**

**Status:** Living document — evolves as the field does.
