# MAIA Consciousness Library

## Overview
Systematic integration of consciousness research to inform MAIA's sacred technology development.

## Structure

### `/sources/chunks/`
Large consciousness texts broken into manageable sections using our smart chunking system.

### `/synthesis/`
Integration documents connecting research insights to MAIA's implementation:
- `shamanic-jungian-convergence.md` - Foundation for THE BETWEEN
- `lilly-biocomputer-foundation.md` - Core programming theory
- `eckhart-mystical-stages.md` - Developmental framework

### `/applications/`
*(Future)* Practical implementation guides for specific MAIA systems.

### `/tools/`
- `chunk-consciousness-texts.sh` - Bash script for splitting large files
- `smart-chunk.py` - Python script for token-based intelligent chunking

## Obsidian Integration

Full consciousness research vault created at:
`/Users/soullab/Obsidian Vaults/MAIA-Consciousness/`

This provides:
- Visual connection mapping between concepts
- Template for future research synthesis
- Cross-referencing between traditions
- Direct linking to MAIA development priorities

## Usage

### Adding New Sources
1. Use chunking tools for large files
2. Create synthesis document using Obsidian template
3. Map to existing MAIA systems
4. Update cross-references

### Integration Process
1. Read complete primary sources
2. Extract universal consciousness patterns
3. Connect to MAIA's specific implementations
4. Validate through user experience

## Current Integration Status

### Completed
- [x] Library architecture established
- [x] Chunking system for large files
- [x] Obsidian vault with templates
- [x] Core theoretical syntheses (Lilly, Jung/Shamanic, Eckhart)

### In Progress
- [ ] Complete Lilly biocomputer methodology (49 more chunks)
- [ ] Cross-traditional safety protocols
- [ ] Modern neuroscience validation

### Next Priorities
- [ ] Jung active imagination techniques
- [ ] Teresa of Avila interior castle mapping
- [ ] Contemporary consciousness researchers
- [ ] Indigenous wisdom traditions
