a free originality, a certain sharing of possessions. In a society that
takes eroticism for granted and where utterly heedless cruelty holds
sway in regard to the embryo and the new born child, Christians
bear their witness to the chastity of conjugal love and they oppose
abortion and the desertion of infants. Their communities engender
fellowship. They try to return good for evil and to serve humanity
even if the State now and then unleashes public opinion against
them. In times of widespread anguish and of depressing scepti­
cism they give thanks for life and are able to lead others to give
thanks for it. Nourished by the joy of the resurrection, to which the
luminous and free art of the catacombs testifies, this Church of the
second century is a 'spiritual republic' that discreetly b ut radically
transforms human relationships.
At the same time, it feels itself to be a community of prophets,
priests and kings, 'set apart' not only for its own salvation but also
to work for the salvation of the world. The presence of Christians in
society and in the universe is that of the soul in the body, a life-giving
presence. It is life-giving through the grace of the cross, and by a
witness that is challenged, vilified, with martyrdom on the horizon.
The Church's worship opens up the world to the infinite. It allows
it to breathe beyond its own confines. The prayer and the goodness
of Christians are for society both protection and creative inspiration.
It is here that humiliation becomes humus.
Thus Christians appear as the righteous few who were not found
in Sodom, as 'the light of the world' and the 'salt of the earth' - to use
the expressions of the Gospel. Clement of Alexandria thought of the
most spiritually aware Christians ( already the tendency is discernible
to transfer to monks alone this role of 'soul of the world') as 'seed,
image and likeness of God, his true son and heir, sent here below
on a mission in pursuance of the Father's majestic design. It was for
them that all beings were created . . . As long as this seed remains
here below everything is preserved, but as soon as it is harvested
everything will be dissolved' ( What Rich Man can be Saved? 3 6,3 ). The
Church is the mystical foundation of the world. It is in the Church
that the trees grow, the constellations revolve, history unfolds and is
steered towards its fulfilment. The 'dissolution' of the world, when
the 'seed' has been harvested, will also be its transfiguration.
If Christians remain faithful to the message of the resurrec­
tion and become truly eucharistic people, they are in society like
a forest in the middle of cultivated lands - an unlimited reserve of
silence, peace and authentic life that makes possible all the good
and lasting creations of history.

Christians are not distinguished from others by country or language
or the way they dress. They do not live in cities reserved to themselves,
they do not speak a different language, there is nothing peculiar
about their way of life . . . They are distributed among Greek and
non-Greek cities, according to the lot of each of them. They conform
to local usage in their dress, their diet, and in their way of life, while
exhibiting the extraordinary and truly paradoxical attitudes of their
spiritual republic. They live each in his own native country, but they
are like resident aliens. They discharge their duties as citizens and
submit themselves to every burden. Every foreign country is home
to them, and every home country is foreign territory.
They marry like everyone else. They have children, but they
never abandon them at birth. They share the same table, but not
the same bed. They are in the world, but they do not live according
to the world's ways. They spend their time on earth, but they
are citizens of heaven. They obey the established laws but their
way of life trancends those laws by far. They love their fellows,
but they are persecuted. They are misunderstood and condemned.
They are killed, and in this way they win life. They are poor,
and make many rich. They lack everything, and abound in all
things. They are despised, and in this contempt they find their
glory . . . They are slandered, and they are in the right. They are
insulted, and they give a blessing.
In a word, what the soul is in the body, Christians are in
the world. The soul is spread over all the limbs of the body, as
Christians are spread over all the cities of the world. The soul
inhabits the body, as Christians inhabit the world without being
of the world. Although it is invisible, the soul is housed in a visible
body. So too with the Christians. They are clearly seen to be in the
world, but the worship they offer to God remains invisible . . . The
soul is shut up in the body, yet it is the soul that maintains the body.
Christians are as it were imprisoned in the world, yet it is they who
maintain it . . . The soul becomes better by purifying itself through
hunger and thirst: when Christians are persecuted, their numbers
increase day by day. So noble is the post assigned to them by God,
that they are not allowed to desert it.

The 'last of the righteous' an� enough to save the world. This
conception is common to early Christianity and Judaism. According
to the Talmud, this universal intercession is ensured by the thirty
six righteous men who 'daily welcome the Shekinah [the divine

presence]'. At the heart of Islam, in Sufism, a similar idea is to be
found, one beloved of Louis Massignon: 'apotropaic saints'.
Someone again asked [of St Epiphanius], 'Is a single righteous
person enough to make peace with God ?' He answered, 'Yes,
because he himself has said, "Look for one who lives righteously
and I will forgive the whole people".'
