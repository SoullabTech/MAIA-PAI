speaks of the four Living Creatures harnessed to the Lord's chariot.
He says that they had countless eyes. In the same way the soul
that seeks God - rather I mean the soul that is sought by God is no longer anything but gazing.
PsEUDO-MACARIUS Thirty-Third Homily, (PG 3 4,74 1 )
That i s why to reach this stage o f prayer w e have to banish all
thoughts and tricks (as if we could deceive God or prevail over him! ) .
The intellect i s concentrated, words are suspended.
In your prayer time, rid yourself of everything that harasses you
. . . be an ignorant and simple and at the same time a pensive
child . . . Banish tricks and devices and behave like a child just
weaned from its mother.
EVAGRIUS OF PoNTUS Pareneticus (Frankenberg, p. s 6o )

Let your tongue pronounce no word when you betake ym>�rself to
prayer.
EvAGRIUS OF PoNTUS Fragment preserved in Syriac
( Orientalia Christiana, XXX, p. so)

John Cassian recommends a dialogue with God that is silent,
relaxed and trustful, when a person 'shuts the door of his room',
as Jesus requires, that is the door of his inner sanctuary, of his
'heart-spirit'. He suggests frequent prayers but short ones because
of their very intensity, to avoid distraction.
We have to take particular care to follow the Gospel precept that
bids us go into our inner room and shut the door to pray to our
Father.
This is how to do it.
We are praying in our inner room when we withdraw our heart
completely from the clamour of our thoughts and preoccupations,
and in a kind of secret dialogue, as between intimate friends, we
lay bare our desires before the Lord.
We are praying with our door shut when, without open­
ing our mouth, we call on the One who takes no account of
words but considers the heart.
We are praying in secret when we speak to God with the heart
alone and with concentration of the soul, and make known our
state of mind to him alone, in such a way that even the enemy

powers themselves cannot guess their nature. Such is the reason
for the deep silence that it behoves us to keep in prayer . . .
Thus our prayers should be frequent but short, for fear that if
they are prolonged the enemy might have an opportunity to in­
sinuate distraction into them. This is true sacrifice: 'A broken and
a contrite heart, 0 God, thou wilt not despise' (Psalm p . 1 7 ) .
joHN CASSIAN Conferences, IX,3 5-6 (SC 54, p. 7 1 )

S o comes the Spirit who prays i n us, a s S t Paul says, 'with sighs
too deep for words'. Interior tears, a need for silence.
When the Holy Spirit acts in the soul he sings psalms and prays
with complete relaxation and sweetness in the secret places of the
heart. This disposition is accompanied by interior tears, then by a
sort of fullness, eager for silence.
DIADOCHUS OF PHOTIKE Gnostic Chapters, 7 3 (SC 5 bis, p. I 3 2)

All prayer shares, consciously or not, in the prayer of the incar­
nate Word, in his relationship with the Father, in his 'state of sacrifice'
as Cyril of Alexandria puts it. Consequently all one's praying is done
'in Church', in the communion of the angels and the saints.
Anyone who prays shares in the prayer of the Word of God, who is
present even among those who do not know him and is not absent
from anyone's prayer. The Son prays to the Father in union with
the believer whose mediator he is. The Son of God is, in fact, the
high priest of our offerings and our advocate with the Father. He
prays for those who pray and pleads for those who plead . . .
The high priest is not alone in uniting himself to those who are
genuinely praying. There are the angels as well, of whom Scripture
asserts that 'there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner
who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need
no repentance' (Luke 1 5 .7). Likewise, the souls of the saints who
have fallen asleep . . . The chief of all the virtues, according to the
divine Word, is love of neighbour. It must be admitted that the saints
who are already dead practise it more than ever towards those who
are struggling in this life, much more than those can do who come
to the aid of the weaker while they themselves remain subject to
human weakness. For 'if one member suffers, all suffer together; if
one member is honoured, all rejoice together' ( 1 Corinthians 1 2.26).
That is what is accomplished by those who love their brothers and
sisters.

But one can equally apply to the love that is practised beyond
the present life the apostle's words: 'my anxiety is for all the
churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to
fall, and I am not indignant? ( 2 Corinthians 1 1 .28b-29). Does
not Christ himself say that he is ill with those who are ill, that
he is with those who have neither clothes nor house, that he is
hungry and thirsty alongside hungry and thirsty human beings?
Who among those who have read the Gospel does not know that
Christ makes all human suffering his own?
0RIGEN On Prayer, IO-I I (PG I I , 44 8 )
2 . Trials

The masters of ascesis put us on our guard against images,
apparitions and visions. For Satan 'disguises himself as an angel of
light' - which is what he is, except for pride. Especially at the
beginning of the spiritual life, when the soul attains to true prayer,
it receives exquisite visions ( here it is necessary to use the terms of
taste), and these visions make the soul believe it has arrived at union.
It runs the risk, then, of succumbing to delusion and vainglory.
Once the intellect has arrived at true and pure prayer it is likely
that the demons . . . will offer it an illusory vision of God beneath
a form pleasing to the senses, so as to make it believe that it has
fully attained the goal of its prayer. Now all of that, as an admirable
gnostic said, is the work of the passion of vainglory and of a demon
whose assaults make the brain reel.
EvAGRIUS OF PoNTUS On Prayer, 73 (Philokalia I, I 8 J )
When you are faced with the exquisite image, react i n the same
way as you do to the interior uproar unleashed by the demons when
they see themselves unmasked, and take refuge in God in all poverty
and trust. If the temptation persists, recite over and over again at an
increasing rate the Kyrie eleison ('Lord, have mercy') or any other
short prayer, preferably one containing the name of Jesus.
One who strives after pure prayer will hear noises and uproar,
voices and insults. But he will not be dismayed nor lose his com­
posure if he says to God, 'Thou art with me, I fear no evil.'
