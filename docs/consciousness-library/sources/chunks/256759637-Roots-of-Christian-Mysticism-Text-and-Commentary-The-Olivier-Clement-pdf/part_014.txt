These themes are taken up and developed in a very ancient Easter
homily which is wholly permeated with the heat of the battle waged
by the great champion of Life, and resounding with the joy of victory.
The cross is truly the tree of'life, the axis of the world brought back
into line and giving a new stability to creation. Humanity is eagerly
awaited and welcomed, no one is excluded from the marriage feast.
The fruit of the tree of life is offered to all; the blood and the water
flowing from Jesus's pierced side are the elements of a tremendous
baptism, a baptism of fire and spirit. Indeed, the body of Christ
crucified and risen is filled with the fire and wind of Pentecost.
From now on the earth is secretly identified with. this Body. There
is no longer any separation. 'Life is poured out on all things'.
jesus has shown in his own person all the fullness of lif� offered
on the tree [the cross]
For me this tree is a plant of eternal health. I feed on it; by
its roots I am rooted; by its branches I spread myself; I rejoice in its
dew; the rustling of its leaves invigorates me . . . I freely enjoy
its fruits which were destined for me from the beginning. It is my
food when I am hungry, a fountain for me when I am thirsty;
it is my clothing because its leaves are the spirit of life . . . This
tree of celestial dimensions rises up from the earth to heaven, an
eternal plant deeply rooted in heaven and earth, the foundation of
the universe, assembling together all the diversity of humankind,
fastened by invisible nails of the Spirit, so that its links with the
divine power may never again be broken . . .
Since the merciless battle that jesus fought was victorious, he
was first crowned with thorns in order to banish every curse from
the earth, eradicating by his sacred head the thorns born of sin.
Then having exhausted the Dragon's bitter gall, in exchange he
completely opened for us the fountains of sweetness that spring
from him . . . He opened his own side whence flowed the sacred
blood and water, signs of the spiritual marriage, of adoption and
the mystical new birth. Indeed, it is said, 'He will baptize you with

the Holy Spirit and with fire' (Matthew 3 . I I ) : the water is the sign
of the Spirit, the blood of the fire.
When the cosmic struggle was finished . . . he remained stead­
fast at the edge of the universe, triumphantly displaying in his own
person a trophy of victory. Then in the face of his long endurance
the universe was overturned. There is little doubt that the whole
world would have been annihilated . . . if Jesus in his majesty
had not breathed forth the divine Spirit, saying, 'Father, into thy
hands I commit my spirit' (Luke 2 3 .46). And when the divine Spirit
ascended, the universe was given life, strength and stability.
0 divine crucifixion, whose reach extends everywhere and to
all things! 0 most singular of all things singular, thou art truly
become all in all! May the heavens hold thy spirit and paradise
thy soul ! - for he says, 'Today I shall be with you in paradise' (cf.
Luke 2 3 . 4 3 ) - but may the earth hold thy body. The indivisible was
divided, so that everything might be saved, and even the underworld
might know the divine coming . . . That is why he gave himself up
completely to death, so that the devouring beast might be secretly
destroyed. It searched everywhere in his sinless body for food . . .
But when it found nothing in him that it could eat, it was imprisoned
in itself, it was starved, it was its own death . . .
0 heavenly Easter! . . . by thee the darkness of death has been
destroyed and life poured out on every creature, the gates of heaven
have been opened, God has shown himself as man and humanity
has ascended and become God! Thanks to thee the gates of hell
have been shattered . . . Thanks to thee the great banqueting hall
is full for the marriage feast, all the guests are wearing a wedding
garment and no one, having no garment, will be cast out . . .
Thanks to thee the fire of love is burning in all, in spirit and
body, fed by the very oil of Christ.

In the crucified Christ forgiveness is offered a n d life i s given.
For humanity it is no longer a matter of fearing j udgement or of
meriting salvation, but of welcoming love in trust and h umility. For
God has allowed himself to be murdered to offer his life even to the
murderers.
Christ's death on the cross is a judgement of judgement.

so

He who suspended the earth is suspended,
He who fastened the heavens is fastened,
He who fixed the universe is fixed on the wood,
God has been murdered . . .
God has clothed himself in humanity,
For me a sufferer he has suffered;
For one condemned he has been judged;
For one buried he has been buried;
But he is risen from the dead
And he cries:
Who will plead against me? I have delivered the one who was
condemned,
I have given back life to him who was dead,
I have raised up one who was buried.
Who will dispute my cause? I have abolished death,
I have crushed hell,
I have raised humanity to the highest heavens,
Yes I, the Christ . . .
I am your forgiveness,
I am the Passover of salvation,
I am your light,
I am your resurrection.
MELITO OF SARDIS Easter Homily (SC 1 23 , pp. n 6,uo, 1 22)

Who can understand love
But he who loves?
I am united with my beloved,
My soul loves him.
In his peace,
That is where I am.
I am no longer a stranger,
For there is no hatred
With the Lord.
Because I love the Son
I shall become a son.
To cling to him who dies no more

Is to become immortal.
He who delights in life
Shall be alive.
Odes of Solomon, 3 (Harris-Mingana II, pp. 2 1 5- 1 6)
Yesterday I was crucified with Christ; today I a m glorified with
him.
Yesterday I was dead with him; today I am sharing in his
resurrection.
Yesterday I was buried with him; today I am waking with him from
the sleep of death.
