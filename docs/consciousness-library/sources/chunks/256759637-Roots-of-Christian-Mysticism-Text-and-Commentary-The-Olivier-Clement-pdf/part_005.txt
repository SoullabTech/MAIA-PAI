There is no place without God; place does not exist except in
God . . .
I was happy contemplating the mystery of his wisdom and his
unapproachableness. I worshipped the eternity and immeasurable
greatness of my Father and Creator. But I longed also to behold
the beauty of my Lord . . . My ardour, deceived by the weakness
of my mind, was trapped in its own search, when I discovered in
the words of the prophet this magnificent thought about God:
'For from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a
corresponding perception of their Creator' (Wisdom I 3 .5).
The sky and the air are beautiful, the earth and the sea are
beautiful. By divine grace the universe was called by the Greeks
'cosmos', meaning 'ornament' . . . Surely the author of all created
beauty must himself be the beauty in all beauty? . . . But if we are
blessed with an intuition of God, what shall we gain from it if death
does away with all feeling and puts an irrevocable end to a weary ex­
istence? . . . My mind was bewildered, trembling for itself and for its
body. It was troubled at its fate and that of the body in which it was
dwelling when, following on from the Law and the Prophets, I made
the acquaintance of the teaching of the Gospel and of the apostles:
'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all
things were made through him, and without him was not anything
made that was made. In him was life, and life was the light of men.
The light shines in darkness, and the darkness has not overcome
it . . . The true light that enlightens every man was coming into
the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through
him, yet the world knew him not . . . But to all who received him,
who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of
God . . . And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of
grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son
from the Father' (John r . r-14).
My intellect overstepped its limits at that point and I learnt
more about God than I had expected. I understood that my Creator
was God born of God. I learnt that the Word was God and was
with him from the beginning. I came to know tHe light of the world
. . . I understood that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
us . . . Those who welcomed him became children of God, by a
birth not in the flesh but in faith . . . . This gift of God is offered
to everyone . . . We can receive it because of our freedom which
was given us expressly for this purpose. But this very power given
to each person to be a child of God was bogged down in weak and

hesitant faith. Our own difficulties make hope painful, our desire
becomes infuriating and our faith grows weak. That is why the
Word was made flesh: by means of the Word-made-flesh the flesh
was enabled to raise itself up to the Word . . . Without surrendering
his divinity God was made of our flesh . . . My soul joyfully received
the revelation of this mystery. By means of my flesh I was drawing
near to God, by means of my faith I was called to a new birth. I
was able to receive this new birth from on high . . . I was assured
that I could not be reduced to non-being.
HILARY OF P o i TIERS The Trinity, r , r - r 3 (PL r o,25-3 5 )
God i s a bsolute beauty because he i s a bsolute personal exist­
ence. As such, he awakens our desire, sets it free and draws it
to himself. He sets beings within their limits but he calls them
into communion with one another without confusing them. Be­
ing himself beyond movement or rest, he gives to each creature
an identity that is exact and distinct, but is nevertheless capable
of development when brought to life by the dynamic power of
love.
[God is Beauty.] This Beauty is the source of all friendship and all
mutual understanding. It is this Beauty . . . which moves all living
things and preserves them whilst filling them with love and desire
for their own particular sort of beauty. For each one, therefore,
Beauty is both its limit and the object of its love, since it is its
goal . . . and its model (for it is by its likeness to this Beauty
that everything is defined ). Thus true Beauty and Goodness are
mixed together because, whatever the force may be that moves
living things, it tends always towards Beauty-and-Goodness, and
there is nothing that does not have a share in Beauty-and-Goodness
. . . By virtue of this reality all creatures subsist, united and separate,
identical and opposite, alike and unlike; contraries are united and
the united elements are not confused . . . By virtue of Beauty­
and-Goodness everything is in communion with everything else,
each in its own way; creatures love one another without losing
themselves in one another; everything is in harmony, parts fit
snugly into the whole . . . one generation succeeds another; spirits,
souls and bodies remain at the same time steady and mobile;
because for all of them Beauty-and-Goodness is at once repose
and movement, being itself beyond both.

The language of souls is their desire.
GREGORY THE GREAT Commentary on the Book of job, 2,7,II (SC
3 2, vol.2 p. 1 89 )

God is Love. He is the ecstasy of Love, overflowing outside
himself, enabling creatures to share in his life. Through his life they
share the same overflowing force, which we see already displayed
in eros, the love of man and woman, and which is designed to be
perfected in holiness, in conscious fellowship with him who is the
fullness of Beauty and Goodness. Amidst horror and death there
is something greater, the secret of love: the story of creation is
a magnificent 'Song of Songs'. Desire is in the first place God's
desire for us, to which all human (or to be exact divine-human)
eros is seeking to respond. The inspired poet of eros is Dionysius the
Areopagite. And Maximus the Confessor, commenting on him, does
not hesitate to equate eros with agape ( Latin caritas: disintere�ted
love, considerateness and service, which participates in the love of
God for his creatures). Eros expresses chiefly a natural impulse, agape
a meeting between persons that is full of tenderne'ss. One might say
that eros is meant to become the subject of agape.
In God, the 'eros desire' is outgoing, ecstatic. Because of it lovers
no longer belong to themselves but to those whom they love. God
also goes out of himself . . . when he captivates all creatures by
the spell of his love and his desire . . . In a word, we might
say that Beauty-and-Goodness is the object of the eros desire
and is the eros desire itself . . .
