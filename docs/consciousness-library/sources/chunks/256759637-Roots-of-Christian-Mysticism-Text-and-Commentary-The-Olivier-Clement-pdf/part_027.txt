and they shine in his presence during the time they spend on
earth, just as he himself shines brilliantly. Does not the Spirit
say, 'God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness' ?
(Psalm 4 5 ·7). He was called Anointed (Christos) i n order that we
might receive the unction of the same oil with which he was
anointed, and might thereby become 'christs' also, being of the
same nature as he and forming a single body with him. It is
written likewise: 'He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified
have all one origin' (Hebrews 2.u ) .
PsEUDO-MACARIUS Great Letter (PG 3 4,772)
By the Holy Spirit combining with our freedom we are able to
move from the 'image' to the 'likeness'.
All of us who are human beings are in the image of God. But to
be in his likeness belongs only to those who by great love have
attached their freedom to God.

By the baptism of regeneration grace confers two benefits on
us, one of which infinitely surpasses the other. It gives the first
immediately, for in the water itself it renews us and causes the
image of God to shine in us . . . As for the other, it awaits our
collaboration to produce it: it is the likeness of God. When our spirit
begins to experience the deep sensation of savouring the goodness
of the Holy Spirit, then we should know that grace is beginning to
overpaint the image with the likeness. Painters begin by sketching
the outline of a portrait in a single colour, then they gradually
add the lustre of one colour to the other until they copy their model,
right down to the very hairs of its head. In just such a way, the
grace of God in baptism b�gins by making the image once again
what it was when man first came into existence. Then when grace
sees us aspiring with our whole will to the beauty of the likeness,
and standing naked and at peace in his studio, then he adds the
lustre of one virtue after another, and, by raising the soul's beauty
from splendour to splendour, makes it an unmistakable likeness.
Our spiritual sensitivity shows us that we are in the process of being
formed to the likeness. But we shall know its perfection only by
illumination . . . Indeed no one can attain to spiritual love unless
he is brought to certainty by the light of the Holy Spirit . . . And

only the enlightenment of love, when it is added, shows that the
image has completely attained the beauty of the likeness.
DIADOCHUS OF PHOTIKE Gnostic Chapters, 89 (SC 5 bis,

p.

1 49 )

A n d this 'likeness' has meaning only in the dynamism of the
universal resurrection, in the immense river of life flowing from the
communion of those who are at once saved and saviours, a com­
munion that is openly offered and attractive to all. It is a longing of
all Christians (and, no doubt, more or less consciously, of all human
beings of good will) for the ultimate, for the moment when God will
manifest himself - and be manifested by us - 'all in everyone' and 'all
in all'. The 'likeness' is eschatological: it anticipates the fulfilment of
history and of the cosmos and is to be understood in that light.
Human nature received the dignity of the image right from the
beginning; but the likeness is reserved for the fulfilment . . . St
John the Apostle shows this truth still more clearly and in a more
striking way when he says, 'Beloved, we are God's children now;
it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when
he appears' (he is speaking without doubt of the Saviour) 'we
shall be like him' ( r John 3 .2).
And in the Gospel the Lord refers to this likeness as a blessing
to come, and more precisely, as a blessing which his intercession will
obtain for us when he asks his Father specifically on his disciples'
behalf, 'Father, I desire that they also . . . may be with me where
I am' (John 17.24). 'As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee,
that they also may be in us' (John 17.21). In these words one can
see how this likeness advances in some way until it reaches unity,
opening before our eyes the prospect of the fulfilment or end of all
things, when God will be all in all.

Ecclesia: A Place for Rebirth

I . Bride and Mother

The Ecclesia, the Church, is not primarily or fundamentally the
concern of sociology. The institution is merely the visible aspect of
the 'mystery'. Above all, the Church is the power of resurrection, the
sacrament of the Risen One who imparts his resurrection to us; the
new Eve, born from Christ's open side as Eve was born from Adam's
rib. From Christ's pierced side indeed there flowed water and blood
(John 1 9 . 3 4), the water of baptism and the blood of the Eucharist.
Christ has flooded the universe with divine and sanctifying waves.
For the thirsty he sends a spring of living water from the wound
which the spear opened in his side.
From the wound in Christ's side has come forth the Church,
and he has made her his Bride.
0RIGEN Commentary on Psalm, 77,3 1 (PG I ?, J 4 I ), Commentary
on Proverbs, J I , I 6 (PG 17,252)

In its deepest understanding the Church is nothing other than
the world in the course of transfiguration, the world that in Christ
reflects the light of paradise. The paradise of his presence is in
truth Christ himself, who could say to the thief full of faith who
was crucified beside him, 'Today you will be with me in paradise'
( Luke 23 .4 3 ). The world-in-Christ, the new heaven and the new
earth, means the heaven and the earth renewed, brought to us
in the Church's sacraments and in the Scriptures which are also
a sacrament. The different sacraments (or 'mysteries') are in any
case only aspects of the sacramental character of the Church as a

whole, whose heart and brightest light is the 'mystery of mysteries',
the Eucharist.
We need to take refuge with the Church; to drink milk at her breast,
to be fed with the Scriptures of the Lord. For the Church has been
planted in the world as a paradise.
