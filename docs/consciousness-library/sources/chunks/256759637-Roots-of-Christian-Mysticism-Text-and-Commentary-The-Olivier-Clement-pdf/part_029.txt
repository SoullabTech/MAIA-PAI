Origen, whose brilliant thought fertilized all Christian spiritu­
ality, especially, but not only, in the East, compares Scripture to an
almond. He himself is an inspired interpreter of Scripture, and if his
thought has had to be corrected on other points, it remains fully and
directly nourishing in this field.
The bitter rind is the letter that kills and that has to be
rejected.
The protecting shell is the ethical teaching, that, as a necessary
part of the process of going into greater depth, requires a course of
careful purification.
Then the spiritual kernel is reached, which is all that matters,
which feeds the soul on the mysteries of divine wisdom.
The first aspect [of Scripture], that of the letter, is bitter enough. It
prescribes circumcision of the flesh, regulates sacrifices and all that
is meant by the 'letter that kills'. Reject all that as the bitter rind
of the almond. In the second stage you will reach the defences of
the shell, the moral teaching, the obligation of self-control. These
things are needed to protect what is kept inside. But they have
to be broken, and assuredly there will be found enclosed and
hidden beneath these wrappings the mysteries of God's wisdom
and knowledge that restore and nourish the souls of the saints.
This threefold mystery is to be seen throughout all Scripture.

Thus, from Origen to Cassian and Gregory the Great, the doc­
trine of the four meanings of Scripture was to be worked out more
exactly. Four meanings, because the moral meaning is doubled, even
as early as Origen, and made to apply not only to the ascetic
teaching of the Bible but also to the life of the Word of God in
the soul. Accordingly, as Henri de Lubac has admirably shown in his
Exegese medievale: les quatre sens de l'Ecriture (3 vols, Paris 19 59), it
would be possible to distinguish the historical or literal meaning, the
allegorical or typological meaning, the tropological or moral meaning
and the anagogical or mystical meaning. This contemplative reading
of the Bible would foster in the West over a long period a 'spiritual
theology' which would counter scholasticism.
It happens that while listening to the Word the heart is touched
by a particular saying and set on fire. Then one must stop and let
the fire spread quietly.
When a saying of the Lord's kindles the imagination of a hearer
of the Word and makes him enamoured of the Wisdom that
bursts into flames at the sight of any beauty, then 'the fire of
the Lord is come down upon him'.
ORIGEN Commentary on Psalm ro4, 19 (Pitra, Analecta sacra
3, 207)

Certainly one must 'knock and seek' to understand Scripture,
to make out its historical context, and translate it from an archaic
mentality into our own. That justifies the whole scientific apparatus
of hermeneutics and exegesis. But science cannot give a meaning.
If it tries to do that, it conveys a 'contraband type of philosophy'.
The meaning is revealed only to prayer, and certainly to prayer with
tears.
For your part then apply all your zeal to the reading of
Scripture, with faith and the good will that are pleasing to God. It
is not enough for you to knock and seek. What is needed above all
in order to obtain the understanding of divine matters is prayer.

To penetrate to the very heart and marrow of the heavenly
words, and to contemplate their hidden and deep mysteries with
the heart's gaze purified, can be acquired neither through human

science nor through profane culture, but only by purity of soul,
through the illumination of the Holy Spirit.
jOHN CASSIAN Conferences, XIV,9 (SC 54, p. 1 9 5 )

If you wish to attain to true knowledge of the Scriptures, hasten
to acquire first an unshakeable humility of heart. That alone will
lead you, not to the knowledge that puffs up, but to that which
enlightens, by the perfecting of love.
jOHN CASSIAN Conferences, XIV, Io (SC 54, p. 194)

Never approach the words of the mysteries that are in the Scriptures
without praying and asking for God's help. Say, 'Lord, grant me to
feel the power that is in them'. Reckon prayer to be the key that
opens the true meaning of the Scriptures.
ISAAC OF NINEVEH Ascetic Treatises, 73 (Spanos, p. 2 8 8 )

Scripture is an ocean that will never finish being explored. The
encounter with the Word is always new. You know you are going
the right way when your reading brings peace to your soul and fills it
with sweetness. Sometimes you must leave a difficulty aside, and pray.
The meaning .will come through your being rooted in the Tradition,
through being open to that river of life which is the communion of
saints. Indeed, even if you are alone, all reading of Scripture is done
with the Church; there is always a liturgical and eucharistic flavour
to it. The Eucharist, where the encounter takes place, sheds light on
it. The betrothal of Scripture achieves its full meaning and marriage
in the Eucharist, where the Word is heard in the silence of love.
The soul marvels at the novelties it meets on the ocean of the
mysteries of Scripture.
Even if the understanding that swims on the surface of the
waters - the ocean of the Scriptures - is able to dive into the
full depth of the meanings hidden in them, . . . study, provided
it so desires, suffices for it to become firmly attached to the
unique thought of the mystery.
IsAAc OF NINEVEH Ascetic Treatises, 1 (p. 4)

When you approach Scripture, examine the intention of each word,
in order to measure and understand with great discernment

the depth and holiness of meaning that it holds. Those who through­
out their life have been led towards enlightenment by grace feel all
the time a kind of spiritual ray shining through the verses, and in the
spirit they identify the words and their deep meaning . . .
When a person reads the verses with a spirit of penetration, the
heart also is refined and satisfied. With a wonderful understanding
the divine power gives the soul a taste of abundant sweetness . . .
ISAAC OF NINEVEH Ascetic Treatises, 1 ( p. 5 )

Reading one and the same word of Scripture, one person is nour­
ished by history only, another looks for the typical [from typos,
the 'figure' of Christ] meaning, another by means of this same
meaning reaches towards the contemplative meaning. Most often,
these three dimensions are found there at the same time . . . In
this way the words of God advance at the pace of the reader.
GREGORY THE GREAT Homilies on Ezekiel, !,7,8 (PL 76,843 )

But for a Christian, Scripture is not a matter for esoteric study.
It is a Word of life for everyone; its concrete, direct language can
touch the simplest souls, sometimes the simplest especially. And the
mystery of it all will always be beyond the most erudite.
There is a diversity of approaches to suit all conditions. Equally
there are different stages on one and the same route. That is why
we need to know how to carry along with us, without trying too
hurriedly to explain them, the words that so far remain closed to us.
Life, the partial deaths that life brings, the better reception of grace,
all these may one day make us capable of understanding them.
Sacred Scripture . . . tests the strong with its more obscure say­
ings and gives satisfaction to the simple by its concrete lan­
guage, . . . it is intelligible to readers who have little culture,
and educated people continually find new meanings in it. How­
ever, it also transcends all knowledge and all teaching by the
very way in which it expresses itself. For it unveils the mys­
tery �n one and the same language throughout all its writings.
