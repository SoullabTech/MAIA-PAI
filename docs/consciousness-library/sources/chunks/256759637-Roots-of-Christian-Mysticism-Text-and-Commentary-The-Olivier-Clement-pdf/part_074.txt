God abides in him' ( r John 4. 1 6). It is not much to say, 'Love comes
from God'. But who among us would dare to repeat these words:
'God is love'? They were spoken by someone from experience. Why
does the human imagination with its superficial attitude represent
God to itself ? Why do human beings fashion an idol according to
their desire? . . . God is love . . . We see nothing of him and yet we
love him . . . Let us seek below what we shall discover on high. Love
that is attached only to physical beauty does none the less move
us to more profound feelings. A sensual and lecherous man loves
a woman of rare beauty. He is carried away by the loveliness of
her body, yet he seeks in her, beyond her body, a response to his
tender feelings for her. Suppose he learns that this woman hates him.
All the fever, all the raptures that those lovely features aroused in
him subside. In the presence of that being who fascinated him he
experiences a revulsion of feeling. He goes away and the object
of his affections now inspires him with hatred. Yet has her body
changed in any way? Has her charm disappeared? No. But while
burning with desire for the object that he could see, his heart was
waiting for a feeling that he could not see. Suppose, on the contrary,
he perceives that he is loved. How his ardour redoubles! She looks
at him; he looks at her; no one sees their love. And yet it is that
which is loved, although it remains invisible . . .
You do not see God. Love and you possess him . . . for God
offers himself to us at once. Love me, he cries to us, and you shall
possess me. You cannot love me without possessing me.
0 brethren, 0 children, 0 catholic seedlings, holy and heavenly
plants, you who have been regenerated in Christ and born in heaven,
listen to me or rather listen through me: 'Sing to the Lord a new
song!' (Psalm 149. 1 ) . . . and let not your life bear witness against
your tongue. Sing with your voice, sing with your heart, sing with
your mouth, sing with your life, 'sing to the Lord a new song'. But
how ought you to love him whom you are praising? Without any
doubt the one whom you love is the one whom you are seeking to
praise. You want to be aware of his glory in order to praise him . . .
You all want to be aware of his glory. 'His praise in the assembly
of the faithful' (Psalm 149 . 1 ) . The glory of him who is praised is
no other than the singer of the praise. Do you want to sing glory
to God? Be yourselves what you sing.
AuGUSTINE OF HIPPO Sermon

on Psalm r49,2-6 (PL J 8, 2 r o)

John Climacus also uses the intensity of human love to convey
the intensity of the eros that ought to unite us to God, which

is God himself. The image of love and the image of inebriation
overlap. The divine eros quenches and renews our thirst at the same
time - a humble repetition of the enstasy-ecstasy rhythm celebrated
by Gregory of Nyssa in his commentary on the Song of Songs.
Love: its nature is like God . . . its action: inebriation of the soul
. . . its proper strength: spring of faith, abyss of patience, ocean of
humility.
Love and interior freedom and adoption as sons are distinct
from one another only in their names, like light and fire and
flame.
If the face of someone we love . . . makes us happy, how great
will be the power of the Lord when he comes secretly to dwell in
the soul that is pure?
Love is an abyss of light, a fountain of fire. The more it
flows the more burning the thirst for it becomes . . . that is why
love is an everlasting progression.
j o HN CLJMACUS The Ladder of Divine Ascent, 3oth step, 3 (7) &
4(9) (p. 1 6?), 10( 1 6) (p. ! 68), 1 8 ( 3 ? ) ( p. 1 69)

The goal of the ascetic life is not to see the translucence of
one's own soul. For the love that permeates the spirit comes from
Another, whose very transcendence calls for love. Anyone who loves
God with the whole of his being receives a 'total sensation of cer­
tainty of heart', a heart in which intellect, strength and desire are
transfigured in the crucible of grace.
There is no question that the spirit, when it begins to be frequently
under the influence of the divine light becomes wholly translucent,
to the point of itself seeing the fullness of its own light . . . But St
Paul clearly teaches that everything which appears to it in bodily
shape . . . comes from the malice of the enemy, when he says that
the enemy disguises himself as an angel of light (2 Corinthians
1 I . 14). The ascetic life must not therefore be undertaken with
such a hope in mind . . . its sole purpose is to come to love God
with a sensation in the heart of total certainty, which means 'with
all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength,
and with all your mind' (Luke 10.27).

And now, a purple passage from Gregory of Nyssa. The ban­

sound and a heavy scent rising from it, the eager mouth rejecting
a cup in order to suck straight from the bung-hole of the barrel,
staggering everywhere, a dark red whirlpool, a breaking away from
everyday restraints, inebriation with the divine eros. One needs to be
a vine-grower to understand this text, its sparkling symbolism, the
September plenty, the crushed grape, the bodies drenched in must,
the new wine . . . it is the poem of a strict ascetic and a mad drunkard.
It is a poem of ekstasis, of going out of self, when a person is wrenched
away from everyday order and convention, and enters into the whole
power and spontaneity of the true life.
The soul then says: 'Bring me into the banqueting house.
Spread over me the banner of love' (Song of Songs 2.4) . . . Her
thirst has become so strong that she is no longer satisfied with
the 'cup of wisdom' (Proverbs 9.2). The whole content of the cup
poured into her mouth no longer seems able to quench her thirst.
She asks to be taken to the cellar itself and apply her mouth to the
rim of the vats themselves that are overflowing with intoxicating
wine. She wants to see the grapes squeezed into the vats and the
vine that produces these grapes, and the vinedresser of the true vine
who has cultivated these grapes . . .
That is why she wants to enter the cellar where the mystery of
the wine is performed. Once she has entered she aspires still more
highly. She asks to be put under the banner of love. Now love,
John says, is God.
GREGORY OF NYSSA Homilies on the Song of Songs, 4 (PG 44,84 5 )

And this wine is the living water o f which the Gospel speaks. I t is
the j oy of the resurrection becoming consciously ours, and breaching
the absurd and the nothingness, making an enclave of non-death
in which to leap and dance, as Christ on the fresco of a Byzantine
church in Constantinople is dancing and trampling down the gate�
of hell.
Deep water has approached my lips,
springing from the superabundant fountain of the Lord.
I drank, I am drunk
with the living water that never dies.
Odes of Solomon, 9 (p. 207)
