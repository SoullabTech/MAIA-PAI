rest on him, or rather in him, as an unction, the 'oil of gladness' of
the psalm, because the Spirit is the joy of the divine communion.
To name Christ is to confess the whole, for it is to point to God
[the Father, the 'principle' of the godhead] who has anointed the
Son; and to the Son who has been anointed, and to the unction
itself, which is the Spirit. This accords with Peter's teaching in
Acts: 'God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit' (Acts
Io. 3 8 ) and with the teaching of Isaiah: 'The spirit of the Lord is
upon me, because the Lord has anointed me' (Isaiah 6 I . I ). The
Psalmist simply says, 'Therefore God, your God, has anointed you
with the oil of gladness' (Psalm 45.7).
BASIL OF CJ£SAREA On the Holy Spirit, I 2 (PG I 2,I I 6)
By revealing the Father in the Spirit, Christ has disclosed for us
the secret nature of the living God, showing us depths of love in
the Trinity. To return to the great affirmations of the Gospel, only
the Son knows the Father as the Father knows the Son, and as
they are known by the Holy Spirit. In this wonderful unity of
the godhead the One is never without the Other. For God is the
infinite Unity of Persons, each of whom is a unique way of giving
and receiving the divine essence.
That God is, and that he is everywhere and fills the universe, is
known by the angels and the saints who have purified themselves,
because they are enlightened by the Holy Spirit. But where, how,
and what he is, not one amongst all beings knows: only the Father
knows the Son and the Son the Father, and the Holy Spirit knows
the Father and the Son, since he is co-eternal and identical with them
in essence. Indeed these Three who are only One know themselves,
and are known by one another. As he himself said who is by nature
God and Son of God, 'Who knows a person's thoughts except the
spirit of a person which is in him? So also no one comprehends the
thoughts of God except the Spirit of God' ( I Corinthians 2.I I ). And
again: 'No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows
the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses
to reveal him' (Matthew I 1 .27).
D IADOCHUS OF PHOTIKE Catechesis, 5 (SC 3 bis, p. I 8 I )
The following hymn, rising a t once to the mystery o f the divine
cosmic Logos, glorifies in a single sequence the Father as the principle
of the godhead, and the Spirit as the 'bond of the Son and the Father'.

But this bond is himself a Person; nothing in God can be impersonal.
(Likewise the bond between a man and a woman is God himself, as
is seen in the face of their child.)
0 Christ, thine ineffable procreation
preceded the beginning of the ages.
Thou art the source of light,
Thou art the shining ray of the Father.
Thou scatterest the gloom
to illuminate the souls of the saints.

Thou art he who didst create the world
and the orbits of the stars.
Thou upholdest the centre of the earth.
Thou art the Saviour of all.
By thee the sun begins his course
and lightens our days.
By thee the crescent moon
dispels the shadows of the night.
By thine aid seeds sprout
and flocks may graze.
From thy never-failing fountain
gushes the splendour of the life
that gives fertility to the universe.
And thou bringest forth
the clear light of human intellect . . .
As I sing thy glory thus,
I praise thy Father too
in his supreme majesty.
I praise too the Spirit on the same throne,
between the Begetter and the Begotten.
As I sing the power of the Father
my singing awakes in me
the deepest of emotions.
Hail, 0 source of the Son!
Hail, 0 image of the Father!
Hail, 0 dwelling of the Son!
Hail, 0 imprint of the Father!
Hail, 0 power of the Son!
Hail, 0 beauty of the Father!
Hail, 0 Spirit most pure,
Bond of the Son and the Father!

0 Christ, send down on me
This Spirit with the Father,
That he may sprinkle my soul with his dew
And fill it with his royal gifts.

SYNESIUS OF CYRENE Hymns, 5 (PG 66,1 608-9)

The revelation of the Trinity has unfolded and continues to
unfold in history. For Pentecost is a beginning, causing to spring up
a river of life which flows, now underground, now on the surface,
quickening its pace, which will one day - the Last Day - flow out
into the sea, in the universal transfiguration.
The Old Testament has manifested the Father clearly, the Son only
dimly. The New Testament has revealed the Son and implied the
divinity of the Spirit.
Today the Spirit lives amongst us and makes himself more
clearly known. It would actually have been dangerous openly
to proclaim the Son while the divinity of the Father was not
fully acknowledged, and then, before the divinity of the Son was
accepted, to add as it were the extra burden of the Holy Spirit . . .
It was more fitting that by adding a little at a time and, as David
says, by ascending from glory to glory, the spendour of the Trinity
should shine forth progressively.
GREGORY NAZIANZEN Fifth Theological Oration, 3 1 ,26 (PG 3 6,
1 6 1 -4 )

The Trinitarian revelation is included in the baptismal profession
of faith. ' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit', was Christ's command to his apostles (Matthew 28 . 1 9 ) .
A l l our creeds are derived from baptismal confessions o f faith and
consequently exhibit a Trinitarian structure. The following is one of
the oldest, dating from the second century, in which the Trinity is
confessed in definite terms describing the relationships of the three
Persons and their activity in the evolution of the universe and in
history, creating, re-creating and sanctifying.
This is the rule of our faith, the foundation of the building, the
stability of our manner of life.
Article I: God the Father, uncreated, who cannot be defined
or seen, God, Creator of the Unive�se.

Article II: the Word of God, the Son of God, Christ Jesus our
Saviour, who appeared to the prophets . . . according to the times
and seasons ordained by the Father; by whom all things were
made; who, above all, in the last days, to sum up all things in
himself, became man amongst men, able to be seen and touched,
to destroy death, to cause life to spring up, and to establish full
communion between God and humanity.
Article III: the Holy Spirit, by whom the prophets prophesied,
the Fathers received revelations, the righteous were led in the
way of righteousness; and who in the last days was poured out
in a new way on humanity, to renew it over all the earth and
to bring it into union with God.
