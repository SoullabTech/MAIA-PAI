separated from Easter and, suffering or triumphant, its meaning is
always love. 'He who says he abides in him ought to walk in the
same way in which he walked . . . He who loves his brother abides
in the light' (I John 2.6 & 10).
The first and greatest commandment is love. Thanks to love the
spirit sees the original Love, namely God. For by our love we see
God's love for us, as the psalm says, 'He teaches his ways to those
who are gentle.'
EvAGRIUS OF Po NTU S Letter 56 (Frankenberg, p. 60 5 )
The key to spiritual progress according to the greatest exemplars
of ascesis is, therefore, evangelical love for one's enemies. That is, first
of all - something very simple but very difficult - the refusal to j udge,
the refusal to assert oneself by despising or condemning others. Only
such an attitude of mind brings detachment and peace. The rest i�
secondary.
A brother asked Abba Poimen, 'What ought I to do? I lack courage
when I am praying alone in my cell.'
The elder told him, 'Do not despise, condemn or blame anyone.
God will grant you peace and you will meditate in tranquillity.'
Sayings of the Desert Fathers, in Thomas Merton, The Wisdom of
the Desert, p. 46

Make no mistake, however. Christian ascesis is not only or even
especially moderation, self-control, wisdom. It is the folly of those
who in Christ fling themselves into the furnace of the spirit, of
those who themselves have something in common with fire.
Abba Lot came one day to see Abba Joseph and said to him, 'Father,
I keep my little rule to the best of my ability. I observe my modest
fast and my contemplative silence. I say my prayers and do my
meditation. I endeavour as far as I can to drive useless thoughts
out of my heart. What more can I do?'
The elder rose to answer and lifted his hands to heaven. His
fingers looked like lighted candles and he said, 'Why not become
wholly fire?'

To climb a mountain it is not enough to have a map. A guide
is necessary. Hence the importance of the 'spiritual father' in the
tradition with which we are concerned.
The spiritual father is above all a 'spiritual' person, one in
whom the Spirit dwells. And the Spirit makes him an icon of the
divine fatherhood, a fatherhood that as we have seen is sacrificial
and liberating.
Only self-mortification, long, hard and crucifying, makes
possible this acquisition of the Spirit, in accordance with the monastic
saying 'Give your blood and receive the Spirit'. The 'spiritual father'
thus obtains the spiritual gift of 'compassion' (in its full sense of
'suffering with') and along with it the gift of a humble and respectful
understanding of hearts. People come to him asking for a 'word of
life'. And his word cuts open the hidden abscess, frees and awakens
them, sometimes with a touch of humour, like that of the experienced
monk who commanded a young brother who was eager to have his
own way to recite the Lord's Prayer, saying not 'Thy will be done'
but 'My will be done'. The 'spiritual father' is above all a man of
gentleness, kindness and unlimited charity. And thus he brings home
to a person who hates himself how much he is in fact loved.
The spiritual father is able give guidance because he knows the
paths. His role is to keep a little way in front. He does not have
to lay down rules, b ut be an example. He is not a master, a 'guru',
since for Christians the only master is Christ. The destiny of the
spiritual father is that of St John the Baptist: 'He [Christ] must
increase, but I must decrease.'
A brother asked Abba Poimen, 'I am living with some brothers.
Do you want me to be in charge of them?' The elder said to
him, 'No. Do your own work first, and if they want to sur­
vive they will provide what is needed themselves.' The brother
said to him, ' But it is they themselves who want me to be in
charge of them.' The elder said to him, 'No. You must become
their example, not their legislator.'
Sayings of the Desert Fathers, Poimen, 1 8 8 (SO 1,

p.

253)

An example like that does not draw attention to himself. Only
those who wish will follow.
A young man came to see an old ascetic to be instructed in the
way of perfection. But the old man said not a word to him.

The other asked him the reason for his silence. 'Am I your
superior to give you orders? Do what you see me doing if you like.'
From then on the young man imitated the ascetic in everything and
learned the meaning of silence.
Sayings of the Desert Fathers, in P. Evdokimov, La paternite
spirituelle, 'Contacts', 58, 2nd quarter, r967

Sometimes it is enough to enter into the silent radiance of a
presence which, without trying, allows God to shine through.
Three brothers were in the habit of going to see the blessed
Anthony every year. The first two would ask him questions
about their thoughts and the salvation of the soul. But the third
would keep silence without asking anything. Eventually Abba
Anthony said to him, 'You have been coming here to see me
for a long time now and you never ask me any questions.' The
other replied, 'One thing is enough for me, Father, to see you.'
Sayings of the Desert Fathers, Anthony, 27 (PG 65,84)

To have complete confidence in one's spiritual father is to know
that he will keep you in his prayers, that he will concentrate on you
the prayer that he extends over the whole world. For he is one of those
whose prayer defends and protects the world, saves it from falling
apart, and becomes the life-blood of truly creative undertakings, in
the Church as in society. Being 'poor in spirit', meaning emptied of
themselves, of their personalities, of their functions in society, they
allow the suffering of the world to enter into them, they enable
the power of the resurrection to pervade history, to penetrate the
blind passions of human beings.
All the days that our father Pachomius was with us in the body,
he prayed day and night for the salvation of our souls and those
of the whole world.
Coptic Life of St Pachomius

There is no doubt that the whole world owes its continuing ex­
istence to the prayers of monks.
RUFINUS OF AQUI LEIA History of the Monks, Prologue (PL 2 r , 3 8 9 )

There are tears of another sort, those we are made to shed by the
hardness of heart and the sins of others. Samuel wept thus over

The Interior Combat

Saul. So too in the Gospel we see our Lord weeping over Jerusalem;
and in earlier times Jeremiah: '0 that my head were waters, and
my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for
the slain of the daughter of my people' (9. 1 ) . . .
These are the tears of the righteous man crushed under the
weight of the troubles, the anguish and the sorrows of this world.
This is shown clearly by the title of the psalm, 'A prayer
of the afflicted, when he is faint and pours out his complaint
before the Lord'. The person thus introduced is that poor man
of whom the Gospel says: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven'.
