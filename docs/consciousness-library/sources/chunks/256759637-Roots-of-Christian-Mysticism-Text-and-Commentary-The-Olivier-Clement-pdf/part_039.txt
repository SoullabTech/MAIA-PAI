Each one of our souls contains a well of living water. It has in
it . . . a buried image of God. It is this well . . . that the hostile
powers have blocked up with earth . . . But now that our Isaac
[Christ] has come, let us welcome his coming and dig out our wells,
clearing the earth from them, cleansing them from all defilement
. . . We shall find living water in them, the water of which the
Lord says: 'He who believes in me, out of his heart shall flow
rivers of living water' (John 7.38) . . .
For he is present there, th� Word of God, and his work
is to remove the earth from the soul of each one of you, to
let your spring flow freely. This spring is in you and does not
come from outside because 'the kingdom of God is in the midst
of you' (Luke 17.21 ). It was not outside but in her house that
the woman who had lost her silver coin found it again (Luke
I 5 ,8 ). She had lighted the lamp and swept out the house, and
it was there that she found her silver coin. For your part, if you
light your 'lamp', if you make use of the illumination of the Holy
Spirit, if you 'see light in his light', you will find the silver coin
in you. For the image of the heavenly king is in you. When God
made human beings at the beginning he made them 'in his own
image and likeness' (Genesis 1,26). And he does not imprint
this image on the outside but within them. It could not be seen
in you as long as your house was dirty, full of refuse and rubbish
. . . but, rid by the Word of God of that great pile of earth that
was weighing you down, let the 'image of the heavenly' shine out
in you now . . . The maker of this image is the Son of God. He
is a craftsman of such surpassing skill that his image may indeed
be obscured by neglect, but never destroyed by evil. The image
of God remains in you always.

The purpose o f ascesis i s thus to divest oneself o f surplus weight,
of spiritual fat. It is to dissolve in the waters of baptism, in the water of
tears, all the hardness of the heart, so that it may become an antenna
of infinite sensitivity, infinitely vulnerable to the beauty of the world
and to the sufferings of human beings, and to God who is Love, who
has conquered by the wood of the cross.
Spiritual fat is the obtuseness with which evil cloaks the
intelligence.

Ascesis is not obedience to some abstract categorical imperative.
It frees human nature to follow its deep instinct to ascend towards
God. It enables a person to pass from a state 'contrary to nature' to a
state 'in harmony with nature', in harmony, that is, with that human
(and cosmic) material united in Christ with the godhead, without
separation or confusion. This is the testimony of St Benedict, the
father of Western monasticism, and of an Amma, a 'mother' of the
desert, St Syncletica, whose teaching is marked by a very feminine
directness, and always close to real life.
If justice leads us to propose some mild constraint in order to
correct vices and to preserve love, do not at once fly in dismay
from the path of salvation, which one cannot enter except through a
narrow gate. For as you advance gradually in a holy life and in faith,
your heart is enlarged and you run the way of God's commandments
in an ineffable sweetness of love.
BENEDICT OF NuRSIA Rule, Prologue, 47-49 (Centenario, p. 8 )

Amma Syncletica said, 'Great endeavours and hard struggles await
those who are converted, but afterwards inexpressible joy. If you
want to light a fire, you are troubled at first by smoke, and
your eyes water. But in the end you achieve your aim. Now it
is written: "Our God is a consuming fire". So we must light the
divine fire in us with tears and struggle.'
Sayings of the Desert Fathers Amma Syncletica, 2 (SO 1 , p. 299)

And everything is done in Christ. He excites and sustains our
effort. Ascesis is a response of love. It is a positive abandonment
enabling Christ to purify us 'as gold in the fire'. For he is the
goldsmith and the fire is that of the Holy Spirit.
I share everything with Christ, spirit and body, nails and
resurrection.
Christ . . . thou art for me my native land, my strength, my glory,
everything.
Christ is my strength and my breath and the wonderful prize for
my runmng.
It is he who enables me to run well.
I love him as my purest love because for those whom he loves he
is faithful beyond all that we can conceive.

In him is my joy even if he chooses to send me some suffering,
because I aspire to be purified as gold in the fire.
GREGORY NAZIANZEN Theological Poems, (PG 37,623-4)

The Fathers discern three main stages in the spiritual way:
r . Praxis, the practice of ascesis, the purpose of which is to
transform the vital energy that has gone astray and been 'blocked' in
idolatrous 'passions'. Praxis gives birth to the virtues, which love will
then synthesize. These virtues, let us remember, are both human and
divine. They represent so many participations in the Divine Names,
and in the brilliance of the godhead in whose image we are made.
This is not a matter, then, of mere morality. Not only do the virtues
enable us to avoid idolatry - above all self-idolatry - and to gain
the inner freedom that makes love possible, but they have a mystical
flavour. In this chapter and the two following, it is this praxis with
which we shall be mainly concerned.
2. 'Contemplation of nature', that is, some intimation of God
in creatures and things.
3. Direct personal union with God.

Now, these three stages follow in succession in Christ. Evagrius
and Maximus the Confessor relate virtue and freedom to the flesh of
Christ, according to an idea that is not only Christological but also
eucharistic. For Evagrius the contemplation of nature is connected
with the blood of Christ (from whose pierced side the earth was
sprinkled and received its transparency). For Maxim us it is connected
with the soul of Christ; and we know that the Bible establishes a close
relation between the soul and blood.
As for union with God, Maximus describes it under two aspects.
First, our union with the Spirit of Christ (the spirit being the heart and
summit of his deified humanity), secondly, our transition from the
humanity of Christ to his divinity. In a wholly Johannine interpret­
ation of this latter stage, Evagrius refers to the breast of Christ; any
one who rests on it and feels the beating of God's human heart (note
the reappearance of Maximus's symbolism of spirit and heart) is initi­
ated into the divine life, as John was when he rested on Christ's breast.
The virtues acquired are the flesh of Christ and whoever eats it will
find inner freedom.
The contemplation of creatures is the blood of Christ and whoever
drinks it will be enlightened by him.

The knowledge of God is the breast of Christ and whoever rests
on it will be a theologian.
