God envelops in his fullness the person whom he deifies. And
that person by the clinging power of love is united wholly to the
divine energy. From now on there is only one energy of God and
the saints: God is 'all in all', 'everything in everything'.
The creature, having by deification become God, no longer displays
any energy other than the divine, so that in everything from now
on there is only one energy belonging to God and to his elect, or
rather, henceforward there is only God, because the whole of his
being, as is proper to love, enters into the whole of the being of
his elect.
MAXIMUS THE CONFESSOR Ambigua, 7 (PG 9 1 , I 076)

Everything, however, remains pointing towards the transfigura­
tion of the cosmos. Everything is still caught up in the dynamism of
the communion of saints and, through it, in the power of the general
resurrection.
The communion of saints delineates little by little the face of
Christ who is coming. It gives birth to the Logos in history and in
the universe, or rather, it gives birth to history and the universe
in the Logos. The light of Mount Tabor which is the light of Easter
is gradually spreading. It already shines brightly in holiness. It will
set everything a blaze at the Parousia.
The Word comes to dwell in the saints by imprinting on them in
advance, in a mystery, the form of his future advent, as an icon.
MAXIMUS THE CONFESSOR Gnostic Centuries 11,28 (PG 90,1092)

There, in peace, we shall see that it is he who is God . . . we who
w�re unfaithful to this God, who would have made us gods if
ingratitude had not banished us from communion with him . . .
Created anew in him and made perfect in a more plentiful grace, we
shall see in that eternal rest that it is he who is God, he with whom
we shall be filled, because he will be all in all . . . that day will be our
Sabbath and it will have no evening, but it will end in an eternal Sun­
day. That Sunday will be the revelation of the resurrection of Christ,
who offers to all of us perpetual fullness, not only of the soul

but of the body. There we shall be in peace and we shall see. We
shall see and we shall love. We shall love and we shall worship.
AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO The City of God, XXII,30,4 (PL 4 1 ,803)

Just as the body of the Lord was glorified on the mountain when
it was transfigured in the glory of God and in infinite light, so
the bodies of the saints will be glorified and shine like lightning
. . . 'The glory which thou hast given me I have given to them'
(John 17.22). As countless candles are lighted from a single flame,
so the bodies of all Christ's members will be what Christ is . . .
Our human nature is transformed into the fullness of God; it
becomes wholly fire and light.
PsEUDO-MACARIUS Fifteenth Homily, 3 8 (PG 3 4,602)

The fire that is hidden and as it were smothered under the ashes
of this world . . . will blaze out and with its divinity burn up the
husk of death.

What is hidden within will cover up completely what is seen on the
outside.
GREGORY OF NYSSA Homilies on the Beatitudes, 7 (PG 44, 1 289)
Resurrection begins already here below. For the early Church a
deeply spiritual man is one who is already 'risen again'. The truest
moments of our life, those lived in the invisible, have a resurrection
flavour. Resurrection begins every time that a person, breaking free
from conditionings, transfigures them. Through grace is found 'the
body of the soul', 'the outer side of innerness' ( Rene Habachi, La
Resurrection des corps au regard de Ia philosophie, in Archivio di
Filosofia, Rome 1 9 8 1 ). Resurrection begins every time that a person
plunges this world's opaque, divisive, death-riddled modality into
its Christ-centred modality, into that 'ineffable and marvellous fire
hidden in the essence of things, as in the Burning Bush' (Maximus
the Confessor, Ambigua, PG 9 1 , 1 148). Teilhard de Chardin, at the
end of a questionable theory of evolution, rediscovered this lofty
vision of the Greek Fathers: 'Like a flash of lightning darting from
one pole to the other, the presence of Christ, which has silently
grown up in created objects, will all of a sudden reveal itself . . .
Like a thunderbolt, like a conflagration, like a flood, all the swirling
elements of the universe will be seized by the attractive power of the

Son of Man, to be brought into unity or subjected to his body' (Le
p. 1 96).
The saints are seeds of resurrection. Only they can steer the blind
sufferings of history towards resurrection.

The Difficult Love

While [the abbot] is preoccupied with exterior matters he must
not lessen his solicitude for the interior. Nor when he is pre­
occupied with the interior may he relax his watch on the exterior.
Otherwise, by giving himself up to pressing duties from outside,
he would experience an interior collapse; or by keeping himself
busy solely on interior matters, he would be neglecting his exter­
nal duties towards his neighbour.
GREGORY THE GREAT Pastoral Rule, 1,7 (PL 77, 3 8 )
Amid the tumult of outward cares, inwardly a great peace and calm
is reigning, in love.

1 . The Foundations of Love

Spiritual progress has no other test in the end, nor any better ex­
pression, than our ability to love. It has to be unselfish love founded
on respect, a service, a disinterested affection that does not ask to
be paid in return, a 'sympathy', indeed an 'empathy' that takes us
out of ourselves enabling us to 'feel with' the other person and indeed
to 'feel in' him or her. It gives us the ability to discover in the other
person an inward nature as mysterious and deep as our own, but
different and willed to be so by God.
In this fallen world the unity of human beings has been broken,
everything is a 'rat race', and I try to free myself from the anguish

The Difficult Love

that torments me by projecting it on to another, the scapegoat of
my tragic finiteness. The other person is always my enemy and I
need him to be so. In Christ, however, death has been defeated,
my inner hell transformed into the Church, I no longer need to
have enemies, no one is separated from anyone. The criterion of the
depth of one's spiritual growth is therefore love for one's enemies, in
accordance with the paradoxical commandment of the Gospel that
takes its meaning solely from the cross - Christ's cross and ours and from the resurrection - again Christ's and our own.
One day I saw three monks insulted and humiliated in the same
way at the same moment. The first felt he had been cruelly hurt;
he was distressed but managed not to say anything. The sec­
ond was happy for himself but grieved for the one who had
insulted him. The third thought only of the harm suffered by his
neighbour, and wept with the most ardent compassion. The first
was prompted by fear; the second was urged on by the hope of
reward; the third was moved by love.
