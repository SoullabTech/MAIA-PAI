Hardly anything is known of Cyril's origins and formation but he was
destined for the priesthood, and his priestly ministry consisted chiefly
of catechism and preaching. He became bishop of Jerusalem about
3 50. Persecuted by the Arians whom he steadfastly opposed, he was
three times ejected from his see. However, like many Eastern bishops,
while admitting Christ's perfect divinity, he avoids the homoousion.
He was caught up in the great movement of reconciliation that
culminated in the Council of Constantinople in 3 8 I , a Council that
definitively rehabilitated him: 'He was canonically elected and fought
against the Arians'. Fighter and peacemaker, he was a foe to all magic
forms of sacramentalism and he did not hesitate in a time of famine
to sell materials consecrated to sacred uses, which the devout were
scandalized to see subsequently being worn by an actress.
Cyril of Jerusalem is essentially a catechist. His 25 Baptismal
Catecheses, the last five of which, known as 'Mystagogical', are
perhaps the work of his successor John, follow the rhythm of Chris­
tian initiation: the history of salvation, entirely biblical, during Lent;
and access to the mysteries, baptism, confirmation and the Eucharist
(which because they are mysteries are explained in the 'mystagogical'
catecheses), during the Easter vigil.
These texts are precious for enabling us to understand the mean­
ing which the early Church gave to the principal sacraments, and
its practice in administering them. Cyril's sensitivity has something
Semitic about it - he looks upon life and the body and creation with
the eyes of one who blesses them.

CYRILLONAS (second half of the 4th century)

A Syrian poet and hymn-writer. Almost nothing is known of his life
save that he came from Mesopotamia and was a deacon, perhaps a
bishop. Six of his compositions survive, some of them memre, narra­
tives, others madrashe, hymns. They are as beautiful and spiritually
profound as those of St Ephraim. In one of them he alludes to the
invasion of the Huns (and of locusts - a cosmic calamity rather than
historical ! ) in 3 96, the only chronological indication connected with
his name.

D IADOCHUS OF PHOTIKE ( 5th century)

He is one of the principal spi�itual authorities of the Christian East,
and one of the first witnesses to the 'Jesus prayer'.
Little is known of his life. He was bishop of Photike in Epirus
and connected with the whole monastic movement of the region at the
time of the Council of Chalcedon (4 5 I ). He criticized Monophysitism
(the doctrine of a single nature in Christ) which that Council rejected.
H.I. Marrou advances the hypothesis that he had been carried off in
a Vandal raid on Epirus (Procopius mentions the rai d ) and taken
captive to Carthage. This would account for the fact that the influence
of this initiator of Byzantine tradition is found in the treatise On the
Contemplative Life by Julian of Pomerium who lived in Africa before
becoming the teacher of Caesarius of Aries. This might be the origin
of Diadochus' uninterrupted influence in the West, right through to
Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Avila.
Diadochus' spirituality is well balanced: austere, certainly, but
with allusions to secular life and art that testify, as his style does, to
a profound humanist culture.
Diadochus fought against the amoral (and anti-cultural) quiet­
ism of the Messalians. (This Gnostic sect appeared in the fourth
century in Asia Minor. The Messalians endeavoured to pray without
ceasing by continuously reciting the Lord's Prayer - hence their name,
which comes from the Syriac word for prayer. When once the demon
that dwelt deep within the soul had been driven out, the 'spiritual'
person, whatever he might do, could no longer sin. Like all the
Gnostics, the Messalians held the material world to be fundamentally
evil, so they rejected the Old Testament, that is, God as Creator, and
the sacraments of the Church. They occupy an important place in the
complex genealogy of medieval Catharism.) Diadochus criticised the
idea of an apatheia that once it was acquired would dispense one
from ethical endeavour. He showed himself more than reserved in
regard to visions. He emphasized that the devil is exterior to the heart
of a baptized person, and he stressed the 'educative desolation' by
which God leads a person to humility. Steeped in the thought of

Evagrius, he reorganized those ideas into a more biblical, warmer
tradition, that of the 'heart' as the organ of loving awareness that
brings the whole personality into action. His predominant intuition
is that of the 'experience of God', an experience of the 'heart' and also
of the 'mind'. He expresses it in a language that is paradoxical, for
a Greek, yet it aptly conveys the transfiguration of the whole being,
including the body, starting from the organ that is its true centre.
This 'feeling of the heart' that was shattered by the fall is re­
unified by grace and it brings a person certainty and plerophoria
( plenitude). 'Mindfulness of God' is obtained by the 'invocation of
the Lord Jesus' and by 'meditation on his holy and glorious Name.'
Diadochus is therefore one of the first witnesses to the monologistos
prayer consisting of one word only: the Name of Jesus.

DmACHE or TEAC H I NG OF THE TwELVE A P O STLES (c. I oo)

This small book, the exact title of which is Instruction from the
Lord through the Twelve Apostles to the Pagans, was discovered at
Constantinople in 1 87 5 and gives us a better understanding of the life
of the first Christians. It was regarded in the .C hurch of Egypt as an
inspired book by the end of the fourth century and found a place in
canonical and liturgical compilations accredited to the Apostles.
It is meant probably as a sort of manual, a collection of instruc­
tions put together by a missionary (an 'apostle') for the use of his
communities. It doubtless constitutes - for there is a 'riddle of the
Didache' - the specifically Christian or Judaeo-Christian develop­
ment of a Jewish catechism, The Two Ways, that is akin to the Rule
of Qumran. Thus the Didache can be dated to the end of the first
century, and assigned to the first Christian communities of Palestine
and Syria.
It comprises three parts. The first presents a general view of
Christian existence, the way of life opposed to the way of death.
The second, liturgical, part treats of baptism 'in the Name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit', in running water if possible;
of fasting, on Wednesdays and Fridays; of the eucharistic 'breaking of
bread' preceded by a collective confession of sins and the looking for
Christ's return. The third part is concerned with the organization

of the communities. Their local leaders are called 'bishops' and
'deacons', but the part played by itinerant charismatics - 'prophets'
and 'apostles' - is still considerable. The text concludes on a note of
eschatological vigilance.
