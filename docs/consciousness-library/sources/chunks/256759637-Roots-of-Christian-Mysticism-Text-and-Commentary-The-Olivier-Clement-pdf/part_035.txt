The 'one, holy, catholic and apostolic' Church is fully manifest
in the eucharistic congregation presided over by the bishop, who
delegates to his priests the responsibility of representing him in their
various parishes. As the image of Christ the bishop gathers the local
people together to form a eucharistic body. The bishop therefore
incorporates the Church. But the Church equally incorporates the
bishop, who is a servant of her communion. The body of priests
grouped round their bishop makes up the presbyterium.
Each one individually and all of you together are united in one and
the same faith in Jesus Christ, Son of Man and Son of God, in
obedience to the bishop and the presbyterium, in harmony, breaking
one loaf of bread which is the� medicine of immortality, an antidote
to death that gives eternal life in Jesus Christ.
IGNATIUS OF ANTIOCH To the Ephesians, 20,2 (SC 10, p. 90)

The Church is the people in union with their bishop . . . Thus you
must know that the bishop is in the Church and the Church in the
bishop.
CYPRIAN OF CARTHAGE Letter 66, 8,3 (Belles Lettres II, p. 226)

These eucharistic congregations combine with one another to
form the universal Church, since there exists through time and space
a single Eucharist celebrated by Christ, our High Priest. This unity of
the many is expressed in a whole catena of Trinitarian analogies. It
takes effect around centres of communion that have the 'care', that

Ecclesia: A Place for Rebirth

is, the responsibility o f circulating information, witness, life a n d love
amongst local congregations. For a local congregation shows the
unity of the Church only in so far as it is in communion with all
the others, j ust as the divine Persons exist in one another.
These Trinitarian analogies are to be found in the Thirty Fourth
Canon of the Apostles, as it is called (in fact, in its present form cer­
tainly a third century document) . The ministry of the leading bishop,
analogous to the role of Father in the Trinity, is one of 'kenosis' de­
signed to ensure a loving 'perichoresis' between the local churches.
These 'centres of harmony' are arranged hierarchically from the
region (the ecclesiastical province with its metropolis) to the patriar­
chate which can be either an area of civilization or, in the modern age,
a nation. Already at the beginning of the second century, St Ignatius of
Antioch in the prologue to his Letter to the Romans praises the voca­
tion of the church of Rome to exercise a universal oversight to ensure
the communion of all the local Churches. He calls the Bishop of Rome
'the person in charge of charity'. St Iremeus specifies the role of this
Church as the privileged witness of the apostolic Tradition.
The reunion in depth of all Christians today largely depends, as
is well known, on the ability of the Church of Rome, the Church of
Peter and Paul, to recover her vocation to exercise the kenosis of
charity in the service of all the sister Churches.
The bishops of each people need to know which among them is
the first, and look upon him as their head. And they should do
nothing of importance without consulting him, since each of them
has the duty of undertaking only what concerns his own diocese
and its rural dependencies. But let the leader on his part do nothing
without consulting all. In this way there will be harmony, and God
will be glorified through Christ in the Holy Spirit.
Thirty Fourth Canon of the Apostles, Apostolic Constitutions, 8,47
( Funk I, pp. 572-574)

With this Church [of Rome], because of its pre-eminent origin,
every Church must necessarily be in agreement, that is to say, the
faithful everywhere. For therein has been preserved for all time, to
the benefit of all, the Tradition that comes from the apostles.
IRENIEUS OF LYONS Against Heresies, II1,3,2 (SC 2 1 1 , p. 3 2)

The 'sacrament of the altar' is reflected and extended in the
'sacrament of our brother', as St John Chrysostom repeats continu­
ally. No one can receive God's pardon and peace in the Eucharist

without also becoming a person of pardon and peace. No one
can take part in the eucharistic feast without becoming a person
prepared to share. In the Church of the first three centuries many
of the faithful brought with them to the eucharistic gathering not
only the bread and wine necessary for the celebration, but also the
wealth that they wished to share.
Then comes the distribution and sharing out of the eucharistic gifts
among all, and the absent are sent their share by the ministry of
the deacons. Those who have plenty and wish to give, give freely
according as they wish. The whole of what has been collected
is handed over to the president and he gives help to orphans,
widows, those who are in need because of illness or for some
other reason, prisoners, strangers passing through; in short, he
gives succour to all who are in need.
JusTIN Apology, 1,67 (PG 6,84)
The Eucharist not only establishes the existence of the Church
and the communion of Christians among themselves, but determines
the manner in which these are present in the world. For everyone is
called 'to give thanks in all circumstances' ( r Thessalonians 5 . r 8), to
become a 'eucharistic person'. Making the Eucharist part of oneself,
especially by the invocation of the name of Jesus, is one of the funda­
mental themes of Christian spirituality. The eucharistic celebration is
an apprenticeship in new relations among people, and between people
and things; it cannot but have a prophetic dimension.
Venerate the nature of the offering itself. Christ is there, sacrificed.
And for what purpose was he sacrificed? To bring peace to the
things of heaven and earth, to reconcile you with the God of the
universe and make you his friend . . . What the Son of God has done
in this way, you must do too as far as your human strength allows,
by being a builder of peace both for yourself and for others . . . That
is why at the moment of the sacrifice, the only commandment of
which he reminds you is to be reconciled with your brother. Thus
he shows you that this is more important than the others.
jOHN CHRYSOSTOM On the Treachery ofJudas, Homily r, 6
( PG 4 9 , 3 8 1 )
Do you wish to honour the body of the Saviour? Do not despise it
when it is naked. Do not honour it in church with silk vestments

Ecclesia: A Place for Rebirth

while outside you are leaving it numb with cold and naked. He who
said, 'This is my body', and made it so by his word, is the same
that said, 'You saw me hungry and you gave me no food. As you
did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.' Honour
him then by sharing your property with the poor. For what God
needs is not golden chalices but golden souls.
