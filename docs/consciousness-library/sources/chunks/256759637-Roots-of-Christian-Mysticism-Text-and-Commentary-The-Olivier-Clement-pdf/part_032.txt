was the body of a divine Person assuming that nature, with the whole
universe, in order to offer them up. Incarnate, the Logos remained the
subject of the logoi, the spiritual essences, of all created beings.
At the same time God-made-man had to accept into himself
all our finiteness, our whole condition of separation and death, in
order to fill it all with his light.
It is this deified humanity, this deified creation, this transfigured
bread and wine, this body bathed in glory yet bearing for ever the
wounds of the Passion, that the Eucharist communicates to us.
The Magi adored this body lying in the manger . . . It is not now
lying in a crib that I see thee but upon the altar.
You should believe that today also it is the same meal over
which Jesus presides. There is no difference between this [the
Eucharist] and that.
This is that same body that was covered in blood, pierced by
the spear, pouring forth the saving streams of blood and ·water, for
the whole world.
Christ soared up from the depths of the abyss in dazzling light
and leaving his rays there he went up to his throne in heaven. It is
that body that he gives us to hold and to eat now.

Gregory of Nyssa, summarizing his teaching on this subject,
recalls that the body of the Word was nourished with bread, so that
bread can still today be integrated with and assimilated by the Body
of the Word. And this deified bread is not so much consumed by us
as we are consumed by it. ' The Eucharist transforms the faithful into
itself ', according to Maximus the Confessor.
What then is this remedy? Nothing other than that glorious body
which showed itself stronger than death and has become the source
of life for us. Just as a little leaven, according to the Apostle's words,
is mixed with all the dough, so the body that was raised by God to
immortality, once it is introduced into our body, wholly changes it
and transforms it into his own substance . . .
The Word of God . . . once it became incarnate . . . provided
his body with the means of subsistence in the usual suitable ways:
he maintained its substance with the help of . . . bread. Even in
normal conditions, when one sees bread, one sees in a sense the

human body, since bread absorbed by the body becomes the body
itself. So here, the body in which God had become incarnate, since
it was fed on bread, was in a sense identical with the bread - the
food transforming itself, as we have said, to take on the nature of the
body. It was recognized, in fact, that this glorious flesh possessed the
property common to all human beings: like them it was maintained
with the help of bread. But this body partook of the divine dignity
because of the indwelling of the Word. We are therefore entitled to
believe that the bread hallowed by the Word of God is transformed
to become the body of the Word . . .
As the bread transformed into that body was thereby raised
to divine power, a similar change happens to the bread of the
Eucharist. In the former case the grace of the Word hallowed the
body that drew its substance from bread, and in a sense was itself
bread. Likewise in the Eucharist the bread is hallowed by the Word
of God and prayer . . . It is transformed at once into his body . . .
as expressed in these words: 'This is my body' . . .
That is why, in the economy of grace, he gives himself as seed
to all the faithful. His flesh composed of bread and wine is blended
with their bodies to enable human beings, thanks to their union with
his immortal body, to share in the condition of incorruptibility.

The world was created as an act of celebration, so that it
might share in grace and become Eucharist through the offerings
of human beings. And that is precisely what Christ, the last Adam,
has accomplished. By his death and resurrection he has brought
glory to the universe. It is this transfigured creation that is offered
to us in the Eucharist in order that we too may be able to join
in this work of resurrection. 'The bread of the Communion,' St
John Damascene said, 'is not mere bread but bread united with
the godhead' ( On the Orthodox Faith, IV, I 3 ). And it is united, not
by a new process of incarnation but by integration with the body
of Christ. The bread and the wine are transformed into Christ's
body and blood and thereby 'plenified', made perfect, transfigured
in accordance with their original purpose.
As far as we are concerned, our thinking accords with the
Eucharist, and the Eucharist in its turn confirms our thinking. We
offer to God what is his own, as we proclaim the communion and
union of flesh and Spirit. For in the same way that earthly bread,

Ecclesia: A Place for Rebirth

after having received the invocation of God, is no longer ordinary
bread but Eucharist, made up of two components, one earthly the
other heavenly, so our bodies that share in the Eucharist are no
longer corruptible, because they have the hope of the resurrection.
IREN�us OF LYONS Against Heresies, IV, r 8,5 (SC roo bis,
pp. 6 1 0- 1 2)

Denials of the salvation and regeneration of the flesh are futile.
For if there is no salvation for the flesh, then the Lord has not
redeemed us by his blood, the cup of the Eucharist is not com­
munion in his blood, and the bread which we break is not his
body. For blood can issue only from veins, from flesh, from the
whole human substance, and it is because he truly became all
this that the Word of God redeemed us by his blood . . . And
because we are his members and are fed by means of created
objects - things he himself provides for us by making the sun
rise and the rain fall - he declared that the cup, part of creation,
is his own blood by which our blood is strengthened. He likewise
pronounced the bread, part of creation, to be his own body by
means of which our bodies are strengthened.

This union with Christ - one flesh in the coming together of
two persons - is expressed in a nuptial symbolism that applies to
the Church as a whole, as well as to every soul that makes itself
'ecclesial'. This symbolism extends as widely as the communion
of saints: the marriage at Cana, the marriage supper of the Lamb,
and the symbolism of the Song of Songs describing the wine of the
Eucharist as intoxication with the divine eros.
For those acquainted with the hidden meaning of the Scriptures, the
invitation to the mystery that was given to the apostles is identified
with that of the Song of Songs: 'Eat, 0 friends, and drink deeply'.
In both cases, in fact, it is said, 'Eat and drink deeply' . . . and
the intoxication is Christ himself.
GREGORY OF NYSSA Homilies on the Song of Songs, 10 (PG 44,98 5 )

The Eucharist requires the memorial (or anamnesis) o f the whole
history of salvation. This is epitomized in its central point, the
life-giving cross, the cross of Easter. These events which are written
