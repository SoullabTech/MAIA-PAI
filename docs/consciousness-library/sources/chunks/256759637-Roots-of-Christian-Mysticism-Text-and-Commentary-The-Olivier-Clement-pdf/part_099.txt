reason. Consequently i t i s the duty o f Christianity to make its own
all the religious traditions of mankind, all its philosophical and scien­
tific searchings. Therefore Clement, whose store of Greek culture
was enormous, and who was well acquainted also with Jewish and
J udaeo-Christian exegetical traditions, worked out a huge synthesis
intended as an appropriate introduction to the study of them all.
In the Protrepticus (Exhortation) he addresses himself to the
pagans, to convert them to the new Orpheus, the plenary revelation of
the cosmic and historical Logos. In the Paedagogus (Tutor) he
offers the new converts a moral teaching, the aim of which is
purification of the mind. It is a transfiguration of Stoic ethics, a
Christian humanism that is pacific, serene, moderate in its austerity,
not a break with the world but freedom for the soul. In the Stromateis
(miscellanies, many-coloured tapestries) his exegesis introduces the
reader to the mystery of the cosmos and then to the mystery of God.
The gnosis of love is an infinite progression in this life and the next
through the angelic abodes: God in giving himself 'continually with­
draws to a distance from one who seeks him' (Stromateis I, II, 5 ,4 ) .

CYPRIAN O F CARTHAGE (C. 200 - 2 5 8 )

H e is the principal authority o f the Latin Church before S t Augustine.
He is an important witness to Tradition in regard to the nature and
life of the Church, although his thought on the boundaries of the
Church and salvation is, under the influence of Tertullian, a brupt
and restrictive.
Thascius (Caecilius) Cyprianus was born at the beginning of
the third century, presumably at Carthage, into a rich and cultured
pagan family. He was a famous but agonized orator, and 'he became
a Christian under the influence of the priest Caecilius from whom he
received his second name. He gave all his fortune to the poor' (St
Jerome, Illustrious Men, 67). He was soon elected 'by the voice of
the people' to be bishop of Carthage, in 248. A year later the Decian
persecution broke out. Cyprian chose to go underground but to keep
in touch with his people. On his return to Carthage he had to cope
with the schisms that had been brought about, in Africa as in Rome,

by the problem of how to deal with the lapsi, Christians who had
denied their faith during the persecution and later asked to be received
back into the Church. Cyprian imposed a severe penance on them.
During the plague of 2 5 2-254 persecution threatened afresh, many
holding those 'atheists', the Christians, responsible for the disaster. But
Cyprian appeased the people by his heroic organization of relief.
From 2 5 5 Cyprian came into conflict with the Bishop of Rome,
Stephen, on the question of baptism administered by heretics. Stephen
admitted its validity. Cyprian denied it, and his point of view was
confirmed by the councils that met under his presidency at Carthage
in 2 5 5-256. But soon persecution broke out again and first Stephen
and then Cyprian in 2 5 8 suffered martyrdom.
Apart from his apologetic and moral writings, Cyprian's most
important works - his 8 1 Letters and his treatise On the Unity of
the Church - are concerned with ecclesiology. Ecclesial communion
demonstrates Trinitarian love. Fundamentally the Church is the local
eucharistic community around its bishop. The unity of the universal
Church remains to be defined. For Cyprian, all the bishops together
- in solidum - sit on the 'chair of Peter'. Each bishop therefore, to
the extent of his communion with the others, is the successor of Peter.
The Bishop of Rome is the sign of the unity of the episcopate but he
has no j urisdiction over his peers.
The Letters have been recently edited, in an English translation by
G.W. Clarke, in the Ancient Christian Writers series (4 vols.).
CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA (c.3 76 - 444)

This 'pope' of Alexandria, a veritable 'pharaoh' of Christian Egypt by
family tradition (he was the nephew of his predecessor Theophilus),
presents two different faces to posterity. On the one hand he is a
powerful this-worldly ruler, who controls the supply of provisions
to the capital of the Empire, Constantinople; who owns vast landed
estates; who mobilizes the roughest of the Coptic monks for riots
and pogroms; who buys the necessary complicity of members of
the Emperor's entourage. Relentless in imposing the superiority of
his see on the East, his reputation was permanently blemished by
the 'Synod of the Oak' in 403 to which he accompanied his uncle.
On that occasion Theophilus brought about the deposition of John
Chrysostom, who was doubly his enemy, as an Antiochene and as
Archbishop of Constantinople. Cyril himself harshly manipulated the

Biographical Notes

Council of Ephesus in 43 I, in his turn bringing about the deposition
of Nestorius, the capital's archbishop, not allowing him to defend
himself, and without waiting for the Antiochenes to arrive. He was a
traditionalist who put the principle of authority in first place (at least
in his own Alexandrian tradition). He detested change. He persecuted
Jews and heretics and drove them out of Alexandria. He allowed a
fanatical mob to massacre the beautiful virgin Hypatia who was
a great mathematician and a neo-Piatonist philosopher.
Cyril's other face, however, is �hat of a profound theologian,
Johannine in his inspiration; and this phenomenon is understandable
in an ideology the kernel of which was not political but spiritual.
He laid the emphasis on the unity of the divine and human in
Christ, to the extent of speaking of 'a single incarnate nature of
the divine Logos', an ambiguous formula which he believed was
that of Athanasius but which was in fact that of Apollinaris (for
whom the Logos in Christ takes the place of the human soul) and
was used by the Monophysites (a sect that asserted that there was
only one nature in Christ - the divine, which absorbed or utilized his
human faculties) . None the less Cyril confesses the full humanity of
Christ, b ut insists on the fact that the subject of this humanity is a
divine Person. Therefore Mary is not only the mother of Christ the
man, as Nestorius would have it, but she is truly the 'mother of God',
Theotokos. And it is this expression, and this theology, that were
confirmed while Nestorius was condemned, by the strange Council
of Ephesus (4 3 I ), later recognized by the mind of the Church as the
Third Ecumenical Council. It is in conformity with this therefore that,
according to Cyril, it can be said that on the cross God suffered death
in the flesh - the whole mystery of the crucified God.
Cyril develops in this way an 'energetic' theology, a sacra­
mental conception of the humanity of Christ being made divine
by the fire of the godhead, and as a result really making us
divine.
In 4 3 3 this intransigent theologian accepted reconciliation with
John of Antioch in an approach in which the unity of Christ's
person and the duality of his natures are nicely balanced. It is
indeed a preliminary to the grand dogma of Chalcedon (4 5 I ) on
the divine humanity of Jesus.
