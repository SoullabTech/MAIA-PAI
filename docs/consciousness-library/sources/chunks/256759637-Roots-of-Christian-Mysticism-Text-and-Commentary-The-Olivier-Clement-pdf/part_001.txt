PREFACE

Christianity is in the first place an Oriental religion, and it is a
mystical religion. These assertions sound strange today, in an age
when it is generally assumed that to be a Christian means to lead
a good life. As for prayer, what does that amount to but a set of
exercises which are both pointless and tedious? Nevertheless, whilst
our consumer society has lost all feeling for mysticism, on the fringes
there are thousands of people thirsting for it. When we see the shallow
syncretism, the sentimental fascination with anything Eastern, and
the bogus 'gurus' crowding round for the pickings, it is easy to
sneer. But instead of laughing the Churches ought to be examining
their consciences. Whose fault is it that so many have to resort to
Tao or Zen in order to rediscover truths which were actually part
of the Christian heritage right from the beginning? Who has hidden
from them the fact that of all Oriental religions Christianity is the
best and most complete; that mysticism is as necessary to humanity
as science, if not more so? Intellectual research may be exciting,
but it will not lead us to the secret of life. Nor will the truth
be found through consumerism, though of course we must eat.
Nor will it be found through action, although action is inevitable
if we are to restrain our tendency to exploit one another. The
researcher, the consumer, the politician are merely the avatars of
a much deeper human nature. Intellectual knowledge, possession,
action, all express a desire which transcends them. The human
being is a craftsman faber - and rational sapiens - qualities which
we share with the higher animals (the difference between us being
one of degree and not of kind ), but more importantly than that,
we are mystical. In other words our roots are in fact religious and
artistic, and therefore non-rational, or rather supra-rational. As soon
as our material needs are satisfied, deeper needs assert themselves.
It is now twenty centuries since Jesus declared that 'man does not

live by bread alone', and we know today that not even the most
effective psychoanalytical treatment can cure us of a deep sense of
disquiet within us. There is not a superman or revolutionary who
is not beset by unappeased desires. The Fathers of the Christian
Church, for whom prayer was as natural as breathing, discovered
this truth before we did, saying, ' Birds fly, fishes swim and man
prays'. Islamic spiritual writers would later express the same idea,
saying that the first cry of the new-born babe and the last breath of
the dying person together make up and proclaim the divine name.
This anthology of the first Christian mystics therefore meets an
urgent need, that of rediscovering the mystical sources of Christianity.
It is not so much an anthology as a selection of passages with
an extended and lively commentary. The authors represented here
do not appear in chronological or alphabetical order. The extracts
are arranged according to a theological plan, since the book deals
specifically with 'Christian' mystics, those whose spirituality bears
the deep marks of the revelation received from God. Most of these
texts are hard to find, and many have been out of print for a
long time. Some of them will seem astonishingly modern, others
more obscure, but all should prove interesting. For mysticism is an
existential attitude, a way of living at a greater depth. It is not the
possession of any one religion or of any one Church; even atheists can
be mystics. But perhaps Christianity with its fresh vitality was able to
reconcile negation and affirmation in a new way. Perhaps it was a ble
to unite together the divine and the human whilst neither confusing
nor separating them. That vitality is still possible today; indeed the
very future of the human race depends upon it. It is my hope that
Olivier Clement's fine work will convince the reader of this truth.
