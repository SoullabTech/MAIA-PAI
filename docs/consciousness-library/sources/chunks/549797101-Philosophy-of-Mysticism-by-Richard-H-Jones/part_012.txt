•The mind is truly empty and any later sense that there was
          another reality present is simply an unfounded inference; only the
          natural mind is present.
          •A transcendent consciousness distinct from the body is present;
          the consciousness may be an individual’s or shared by all sentient
          beings.
          •A conscious but nonpersonal ground of beingness underlying
          both subjective and objective phenomena is present.
          •A creator/sustainer god that is personal in nature enters the
          “empty” mind.
