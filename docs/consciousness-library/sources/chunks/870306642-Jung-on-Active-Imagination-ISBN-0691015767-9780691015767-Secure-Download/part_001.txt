My most fundamental views and ideas derive from
these experiences. First I made the observations
and only then did I hammer out my views. And so
it is with the hand that guides the crayon or brush,
the foot that executes the dance-step, with the eye
and the ear, with the word and the thought: a dark
impulse is the ultimate arbiter of the pattern, an
unconscious a priori precipitates itself into plastic
form.

(C. G. Jung 1947, par. 402)

Acknowledgements

When I first met Ruth Thacker Fry, she invited me
into her office to see a notebook that contained
everything she could find of Jung’s writings on
active imagination. This was many years ago, long
before the time of desk computers, scanners or
copy machines. Jung’s papers had been typed on
an old-fashioned typewriter, including scholarly
footnotes and annotations. In a playful way she
told me that it was not her idea, but her animus led
her to do it. We both laughed, because I too know
what it is to be seized by the spirit. As we looked
through her notebook together, I asked if she
planned to submit it for publication and she said
no, there wasn’t enough interest yet – but someday,
a volume of Jung’s papers on active imagination
would be published. That unique collection was for
her own use. Her passion for active imagination
impressed me deeply. Dr. Fry, Founding Director of
the C. G. Jung Educational Center of Houston
passed away some years ago, but I trust she would
be pleased that the time has come for Jung on
Active Imagination. The early collection she
compiled and edited is a source of inspiration for
this work.

I am happy to say that Jung on Active Imagination
will now be simultaneously published on both sides
of the Atlantic. David Stonestreet initiated the
project from London when he invited me to submit
a proposal. For many years now I have been
impressed with his vision of Jung and the depth of
understanding he brings to his work. I am grateful
also to Edwina Welham for her patience and skill
in moving it all toward publication; to Patricia
Stankiewicz for her fine desk editing; I owe a debt
of gratitude to Jo Thurm and Judith Reading, all at

Routledge in England. My appreciation to Deborah
Tegarden at Princeton University Press in the
United States, and to many others who work their
magic as they transform a manuscript into a book.

My heartfelt thanks to Andrew Samuels for his
interest, encouragement, and good ideas at many
stages along the way. As advisor in Analytical
Psychology to Routledge, and as colleague and
friend, his contribution has been invaluable.

Renate Oppikofer’s beautiful translation of a
passage by Tina Keller has restored a long-lost
piece of history about dance as a form of active
imagination. Who would have believed that Toni
Wolff was not only an early
Jungian analyst, but also perhaps the first dance
therapist? (See my Introduction on p. 16.)

For me, the great gift of this study has been to
immerse once again in Jung’s writings on active
imagination. I have been inspired and informed
also by the contribution of many colleagues whose
works are cited in the bibliography and text. As I
extracted my questions and explored this rich
material, many individuals offered support and
feedback. Others brought to my attention resources
from the literature that I did not know. Thomas
Kirsch was generous with his knowledge and
interest in historical questions. Reference librarians
Marianne Morgan and Alison Leavens of the C.G.
Jung Institute of San Francisco, Ann Miyoko Hotta
of the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley,
Lore Zeller of the C.G. Jung Institute of Los
Angeles, and Jan Perry of the C.G. Jung
Educational Center of Houston helped me locate
essential papers and passages that are not easy to
come by. My appreciation also to Janet Adler,
Antonella Adorisio, Shira Barnett, Eugene

Stewart, Tina Stromsted, Howard Teich, and Marta
Tibaldi.

It is a special pleasure to thank my beloved
husband and colleague Louis H. Stewart for his
differentiated understanding of the emotions as
sources of the imagination. Every aspect of my
work has the benefit of his wisdom and
playfulness.
