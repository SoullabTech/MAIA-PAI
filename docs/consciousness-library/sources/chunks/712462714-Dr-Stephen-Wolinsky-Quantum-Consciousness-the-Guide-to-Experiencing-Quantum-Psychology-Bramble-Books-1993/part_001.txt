NOW from the author of Trances People Live: Healing
      Approaches in Quantum Psychology comes a step-by-
      step guide to experiencing the underlying unity that is
Quantum Consciousness. Dr. Stephen Wolinsky offers over eighty
exercises to explore and experience the quantum approach to
problem resolution. Designed to be done alone, in pairs, or in a
group setting, this adventure takes us into a new frontier and pushes
the envelope of even the most far reaching current psychological
thought.

                                    00


You will find Quantum Consciousness chockful—abundant with
helpful exercises, insights often based on Dr. Wolinsky's own
experiences, and techniques for altering awareness in situations
where stuck patterns of perception have kept humanity in the caves
of unenlightenment for far too long.

This book breaks new ground in the kinds of experiences made
possible by conscientiously doing the exercises detailed within.
These exercises could very well result in major gains in self-
knowledge and in therapeutic breakthroughs.
