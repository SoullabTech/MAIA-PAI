The following excerpt from a tape recording deals
with the conflict between the need to rest and self-
 squeezing in the most Uteral sense, relaxation and
dysfunctional contracture. In fact, this is an example
of working through a psychosomatic manifestation,
since for the patient in it, the "squeezing of the soul"
by her defensive system was embodied in a parallel
physical symptom which caused her abdominal pain,
 and for which she had sought medical advice.
   So, in dealing with this idea, we are also turning
to the question of how to deal with                 MMDA
                                                    syn-
dromes of type 3 in our proposed classification: those
in which the positive or negative feeUngs of the fore-
going types are replaced by physical symptoms.^ Nat-
urally, an enhancement of physical sensations may be
part of type 1 experiences, but the substitution of
bodily symptoms for feelings understandably occurs in
the measure that the subject will not give in to ex-
periencing the emotional discomfort of the type 2
state. This may reflect the chronic tendency of the
individual, as in the case of this patient, who at the
time of the session may have been described as a
                                    —
hypomaniac hypochondriac Chappy with herself and
unhappy about pains that she tended to regard as the
consequence of her physical illness.
   This time I am quoting only my side of the dialogue
for a pe riod that may have extended over twenty or

     ®The aim   will   here be one of decoding the individual's at-
titudes   toward   self and others which lie encoded and expressed
in   body language.

thirty minutes and eventually led to a figure-ground
reversal in the patient's experience. More than a dia-
logue, in fact, this session might be regarded as
comparable to that between a movement therapist or
a chiropractor and his patient, the verbal part of it
consisting mostly in therapeutic manipulations and thp
patient's reactions to them, often in the form of
postural changes, moans, yells, and sobs.

   Doctor. I can help you then, but I think there
     is only one way in which you can stop squeez-
     ing,       and that                  is      to learn                        how you                         are squeezing,
     become aware how you do the squeezing, and
     you can only really become aware by becom-
         ing that part of you that is reaUy squeezing.                                                                                                •   .


         Did you become the squeezer or just the victim
         of   it?   .   .   .


         Yes ...            Is that                   something you can decide to do
         again?         .   .   .


         I   would     you to tell me what you are feel-
                            like
         ing. Just be aware how it is squeezing.                                                                                  .       .   .


         Preventing what?          Don't interpret, don't .       .       .


         make theories, just go with your feelings. Do
         you feel squeezed?     .                             .   .


         Only there?                 .    •       .


         Does your voice sound squeezed? ...
         Now do you hear it?                                          .       .       .


         Are you aware how you are squeezing your
         own voice, how you squeeze your throat?                                                                                              .   .       .


         You are aware of the squeeze in your chest?                                                                                              .       .


         OK, there is a squeeze in the chest and down
         in the belly, both places.
         You feel squeezed in your movements, your
         arms, your neck, your fingers?                                                               .   .       .


         What about your hands now, and your arms
         now? You are squeezed now?                                                                   .       .       .


         Can you squeeze now, deliberately?                                                                               .   •       .


         No, I don't expect it to be the same                                                                             thing. Just
         experience                 it.       .       .


         What does it want from you?                                                              .       .       .

         What does it respond?                                                    .       .   .


         Can you be it squeezing you so                                                                       that            you know

      what  it wants, what you want when you are

      squeezing yourself? What is it you are wanting
      when you squeeze yourself like now? What do
      you want to do to you? And what is the satis-
      faction you are getting from this squeeze?    .                                                                                      .   .


      Yes, the squeezer is getting a satisfaction. It
      wants to squeeze; it gets pleasure from squeez-
      ing.       .       .       .


      Don't struggle. Let it happen, let yourself be
      squeezed. Don't try to back out, be the victim
      now, let the torture end.                                                                  .       .   .


      You don't have to have the strength to suffer.
      To resist, you must, but if you.    .                                                                              .   .


      Try not resisting now.                                                         .


      Let go. Don't stop it.                                                     .           .       .


      Let go, let go. Don't resist it. Let everything
      be.    .       .       .


      Don't         it, you are resisting it, experience
                             resist
        Be
      it.       open as you can and experience it.

      What   are you experiencing?                                                                               .   .   .


      I saw a lot of activity coming through you for
      the first time. Can you feel ...?...
      Can't you feel any desire for that activity, as
      if you wanted to go back to it? Any enjoyment
      of the                 movement?                               .       •

      Just despair?                            .    .    .


      This being tired                                   is      like a deadness, a grey dead-
      ness, lack of energy,                                                  and                     all this                energy   is   con-
      tained behind                                it.       .   .       .


      And   I feel that in the squeeze you have this
      energy, this force.  . .                                   .


      So you have to become that other side, if you
      want to have strength.                                                             .       .       .


      Maybe, while the squeezing is taking place,
      while you are being open to the squeezer, may-
      be you can experience yourself as wanting to
      squeeze.     .                 .   .


      I want you to talk about it, the squeeze want-
      ing sex. Can you elaborate on this, say more
      how it feels? But try to be the squeezer while
      you are talking about it Say what you want as
      squeezer. ; . .

        Can you   experience the squeeze as your urge,
        your satisfaction?       Your sex urge, your
                                         .    .   .



        anger, your desperation?     Your longing?    .   .   .                     .   .   .


        You still haven't been able to identify with the
        squeezer.   .    .   .


        Well, do     without taking pleasure, just let it
                    it

        come as it comes. "I am the one squeezing
        you," you can begin, even if you don't feel it.
        Just play the game.
        Speak of what you want, you the squeezer, how
        you are, what kind of a person you are.      .                      .   .
