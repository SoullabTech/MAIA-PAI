        DRUG EXPERIENCE
        THE
 THAT CAN OPEN THE DOOR
TO THE MIND'S PRISON CELL...




Psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo details exciting
results   from the use of AADA, AAAADA, Harmaline
and Ibogaine— drugs that defy traditional
classification.   They act as 'feeling enhancers"
— psychedelic,  mind-manifesting drugs— with-
out the disorganizing effects of the hallucino-
gens. The subject (or explorer) can enter deeply
into his feelings, into his true inner self,   and yet
retain complete contact with the ouler world.
   ''A lucid discussion of the two poles of the
drug experience. ..Naranjo's warm, human
qualities and his general discussion of drug use
will warrant recommending this book to the
educated layman. It will broaden the limited
view of drugs generally held"     —Library Joumol

   'Ihope The Healing Journey will stimulate
other psychiatrists to experiment in this area!'.
            —Andrew Weil, author of The Nafurol Mind
