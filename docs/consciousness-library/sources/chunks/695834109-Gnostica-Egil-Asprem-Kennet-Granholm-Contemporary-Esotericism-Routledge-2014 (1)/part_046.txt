Vampire, the Temple of Set, and NocTifer’s satanservice.org; otherwise, most
sites are in the tens or hundreds, indicating a small integration both in the
milieu and outside. Concluding on the basis of traffic rank and links we can
say that most satanic and Left-Hand Path sites live in obscurity.
    In an attempt to answer the final set of questions about connectivity, I used
a third meta-communicative tool called Issue Crawler to perform “snowball”
and “co-link” analyses on the sample which could be translated into a visible
representation called a “cluster map”.35 Basically, a snowball analysis crawls a
given set of sites for links and retains them; this can be done in up to three
degrees of separation, resulting in enormous clusters of equivocal links and
nodes. In contrast, a co-link analysis only retains outlinks that at least two
starting points have in common, restricting the model to confirmed relations.
The results are by far the most provisional, as I have yet to strike a balance of
starting points in either mode to get a manageable model. The problem lies
in the nature of Internet linking itself – all of my data sets were either too
large and inclusive or too exclusive and limited, resulting in misleading charts.
If too inclusive, as most snowball searches were, the data included irrelevant
Facebook pages, porn sites, and other inappropriate links in unmanageable
files of 60 or more megabytes (that is 40,000+ links and nodes, too large for
modelling). If too exclusive, many interesting relations disappear because of
the specificity of co-link measurement. Nevertheless, a more restricted map
based on a co-link analysis of fourteen starting points is very useful, as it
only charts significant links that are mutually supported, indicating a certain
amount of commonality.
    Although a model created with Issue Crawler looks confusing at first
glance, some of the nodes are recognizable sites from the previous lists. Other
sites are expected, like the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance (www.­
religioustolerance.org) who have written extensively and fairly about Satanism,
and the Feral House–Coopstuff connection to the Church of Satan (via pub-
lisher Adam Parfrey and the artist Coop, both affiliated with the Church of
Satan). In addition, when perusing the “extract URLs” result file behind
the model, we find that angelfire.com covers Diane Vera and Joy of Satan,
­geocities.com covers the old Satanic Reds site, and so on. All the same, many
 of my starting points are absent, which is surprising when taking the inlinks
 provided in Table 7.2 into account. A high number of links to the site does
 not guarantee a central place or even a node in the cluster map, indicating
 that sites such as Vexen Crabtree’s or Venus Satanas’s have a reputation (i.e.
 inlinks) outside the satanic milieu in a narrow sense. Looked at in another way
by correlating with Table 7.1, of the websites established before 2000, only the
First Satanic Church, First Church of Satan and the 600 club are absent; after
2001, only Diane Vera, Joy of Satan and Satanic Reds are present, and only

by proxy (through host domains and not their individual sites). So duration
seems to play a role. On the other hand, many of the nodes are not associated
directly with Satanism (like otohq.org, Ordo Templi Orientis’s now-defunct
directory) or not operational, limiting the explanatory power if relying too
heavily on the map alone.
    Is there a “large, heterogeneous online community” of Satanists, as Chris
Mathews, Venus Satanas and Corvis Nocturnum claim, or is there rather a
bunch of loose networks with one dominant community, as Peter Gilmore
asserts? The cluster map indicates that relations and networks of communica-
tion do exist. Correlated with Tables 7.1 and 7.2, we do see actual community
sites, but little to confirm any community in the singular. Combined with a
little surfing on these sites, it is obvious that networks are established by link-
age; for example, Diane Vera links to blog and forum networks, and Satanic
Reds lists “members” and affiliates.36 But little interlinkage is done. Twelve of
the nineteen sites I have analysed do not even show up on a co-link analysis,
indicating that little is done to build or strengthen the network into a mutual
practised community or movement of interest. In fact, using “community” in
the singular glosses over (or completely ignores) the struggles and conflicts
inherent in actual delimitations of “community” between the various groups
and actors. It would seem that heterogeneous communities in the plural do
develop both online and offline, but mostly around relatively homogeneous
social entities, such as the ideologies, worldviews, and practices of organ-
ized satanic groups with specific texts, spokespersons and interpretations.
This is visible in the cluster map confirming the gist, if not the conclusion, of
Gilmore’s argument discussed earlier. For the wider cultural context and the
ephemeral networks within, “milieu” is in fact a much better term.
    This substitution is not done to criticize the veracity of perceived feelings
of togetherness or the authenticity of emotional, ethical, and aesthetic com-
munion between satanic seekers. Rather, it is to emphasize the discursive
nature of these emotions and cognitions, and the basic imaginary nature of
communities and currents. Thus I do not reject the basic understanding of
modern Satanism as a cohesive current, but I do claim that this cohesion is
of a second order far less communitarian and far more fuzzy than implied in
terms like “community” and “movement” in the singular.37 In contrast, “milieu”
acts as an aggregate noun demarcating certain ideological and symbolic inter-
ests and shared patterns of consumption, and it should be understood as a
mid-level analytical concept between the general “occulture”, or boundary cul-
ture between margin and mainstream, and distinct communities, groups and
organizations within it.
