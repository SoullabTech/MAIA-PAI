There are other segments that ring false if one thinks of the Warrior as a civil-
ian and true when applied to a Chechen mujahid, when one takes into account
that dignity, hospitality, and bravery are considered essential in Chechen cul-
ture and that Basayev was once described as “at his happiest when telling
­battle-stories, making his men around him laugh”.53

Anyone who has seen propaganda photographs or recruitment videos of
Basayev and his mujahidin knows that they really sat around small campfires,
drinking tea from dented tins as they waited for their clothes to dry. But the
Manual grasps even more of the Chechen mujahidin’s everyday world and
the tough circumstances in which Basayev lived. The Warrior possesses lit-
tle more than his sword and his shield, sleeps in a tent, is most often spot-
ted out in the field, and “accepts without complaint that the stones along the

path hinder his way across the mountains”.55 Russia’s most wanted man and his
companions probably spent a good many nights if not in tents pitched at the
foot of a cliff, then in improvised quarters. A visiting journalist in 2005 felt he
“was with a group of hunters camping in the woods”, and described their liv-
ing conditions as “very basic, extremely basic”.56 A final and easily overlooked
correspondence between the Manual’s depiction of the Warrior’s life and that
of a Chechen mujahid is the small scale of their wars and the profound isola-
tion in which they take place. Though in the case of the Chechens this was
the result of mostly involuntary factors such as their ethnic isolation and lack
of strong historical allies and, in the Warrior’s case, of his disdain for swear-
ing allegiance to other people, this fact resonated with the moral self-reliance
to which Basayev had long ago accustomed himself. As early as 1995, follow-
ing the Budyonnovsk operation, he had had a clear answer to those onlookers
who condemned him for his tactics:

        You talk about terrorism forfeiting our moral superiority before world
        public opinion. Who cares about our moral position? Who from
        abroad has helped us, while Russia has brutally ignored every moral
        rule? If they can use such weapons and threats, then so can we.57

A decade later, in July 2005, he was downright scathing about outsiders who
declared that he should abide by rules, conventions and laws that the Russians,
too, so blatantly flouted in their conduct of the war:

        As long as the genocide of the Chechen nation continues, as long
        as this mess continues, anything can happen. Okay, I admit, I’m a
        bad guy. A bandit, a terrorist. Okay. So, I’m a terrorist. But what
        would you call them? If they are keepers of constitutional order, if
        they are anti-terrorists, then I spit on all these agreements and nice
        words. And I want to spit on the whole world if the whole world
        spits on me.58

In so far as the Warrior has set himself up as “the one who decides what he
will do and what he will never do”,59 he evinces the same mentality that charac-
terized Basayev until the end.

        We must not try to please either the West or the East. We must be
        ourselves, clench our teeth, and fight on, without looking to either

       down it. But the path of good is narrow, and few walk down it”.60


THE WARRIOR OF LIGHT TAKES SHAHADA

In the preamble to the Manual of the Mujahid, Basayev announced that he
had added “ayat, hadith and stories from the lives of the Sahaba”, and asked
for God’s Mercy if something should not correspond with the Qur’an and
the Sunna. This very overt hope to have fully Islamized the text – each of the
seventy short chapters of Basayev’s text contains at least one aya and often a
hadith – may be regarded as one of the results of his having failed to achieve
either “Liberty or Death” earlier. Over time, struggling itself began to need a
meaning, a meaning which he found in Islam.61 But he also found it in the
Manual. As a handbook for religious struggle that leaves the enemy’s place
vacant and the objective of the Good Fight to be defined by each individual,
it possessed the negative requirements for an Islamizing revision. The most
obvious example is naturally the substitution of “Warrior of Light” with
“Mujahid”. In other cases, a simple supplementation instantly solidified a pas-
sage that, to the non-Christian eye, may seem to lack in content.

       He tries to establish what              He tries to establish what he
       he can truly rely on. And               can truly rely on. And he always
       he always checks that he                checks that he carries three things
       carries three things with               with him: faith in Allah, hope for
       him: faith, hope and love.              His mercy and love of Islam.62

Islamizing the Warrior was easy for another reason as well. Many key words
from the Manual resonate with important Qur’anic concepts: “path”;63
“light”;64 “signs”.65 “The Good Fight” construed as a righteous struggle in which

 61. Until the very end, however, his faith remained a secondary motive for fighting. When
     asked about this around a year before his death, his answer was clear: “For me, it’s first and
     foremost a struggle for freedom. If I’m not a free man, I can’t live in my faith. I need to be a
     free man. Freedom is primary. That’s how I see it. Sharia comes second” (Anon, “Reign of
     Terror”).

     Light” (Qur’an 24: 35).

     In these are signs for a people who can hear” (Qur’an 30: 23ff; cf. mc, 91, 189; bk, 28, 33:
     kc, 75, 141).

winning or losing is less important than the righteous struggle itself can also
be coupled with the Qur’an:

        To anyone who fights in God’s way, whether killed or victorious,
        We shall give great reward. Why should you not fight in God’s
        cause and for those oppressed men, women, and children who cry
        out, “Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors!
        By Your Grace, give us a protector and give us a helper!”?66

Only one section Basayev bluntly mutilated beyond recognition:

        As the Warrior learns from        As the Mujahid learns from
        his spiritual master, the light   his brothers, the light of faith
        of faith shines in his eyes and   shines in his eyes and he does
        he does not need to prove         not need to prove anything to
        anything to anyone. He is not     anyone. He is not bothered
        bothered by his opponent’s        by the enemy’s aggressive
        aggressive arguments which        arguments which say that God
        say that God is a superstition,   is a superstition, that Jihad
        that miracles are just tricks,    is terrorism, that Sharia is
        that believing in angels is       medieval and that one must
        running away from reality.        bow to their military might.67
