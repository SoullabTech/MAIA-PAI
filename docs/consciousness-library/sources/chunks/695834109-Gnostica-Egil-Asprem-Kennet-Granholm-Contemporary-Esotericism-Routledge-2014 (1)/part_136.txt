etc.) and, in so doing, open out multiplicitous subject positions.43 However, to
queer esotericism is not only to mark fluid subject positions and analyse their
critical positioning, it is also to ask questions of the discipline’s own invest-
ment in stable identities and positioning. What is it to queer esotericism’s sta-
tus as “other” to dominant discourse? Can queer refigure the discipline’s own
discursive identities? That is, can we trouble the set of conceptual dualisms
that position esotericism as either personal spiritual practice and academic
field of study? Thinking through the division drawn in the academy between
theory and practice is one such avenue for “queering” the study of esotericism.
What presumptions of subjectivity, scholarship and validity rest upon align-
ing oneself too closely with either of these dichotomous terms? What spec-
trum of relations are we missing by employing the theory–practice dualism
at all? Is it as “simple” as identifying an inherited conceptual Cartesian bias
between the physical–doing (feminine) and the conceptual–thinking (mascu-
line)? Surely not. Wrapped up in such distinctions between practitioners and
scholars are the very foundations of academic identity as detached mastery of
subject; mastery of discourse. Identities of course troubled no-end by post-
structural critiques of the objective author. As Fowden has argued about the
division of the Hermetica into “technical” and “philosophical” works, a com-
mitment to such categorical imperatives can make invisible their shared char-
acteristics and import a division that made no conceptual sense at the time of
their creation.44
    Indeed, at a superficial level it may seem that the study of esotericism as
an academic endeavour is by nature queer with regard to its former (and cur-
rent?) academic marginalization and its multiple conceptual lineages that
privilege qualities and ontologies of fluidity, multiplicity, as well as its empha-
sis – in practice and theory – on relations. As Jagose notes, queer’s “defini-
tional indeterminacy, its elasticity, is one of its constituent characteristics”,45
and the field of Western esotericism is nothing if not elastic and mercurial.
    However, not only is it apparent that gender identity markers – implicitly
or explicitly – remain resolutely normative/deviant and fixed in much schol-
arship on gender and contemporary esotericism, but also that the field’s own
identity-as-other, its assumed “innate” deviance and sexualization is itself a
fixed identity that may usefully prosper in as yet unknown ways if not only
its objects of study are queered but also its disciplinary formation. Such a
project is conceptually slippery terrain, and while some academics would seek
to highlight esotericism’s deviance as part of its identity, others desire to mark
its normalcy and integral place within the academy. Both are strategically valid
and exceptionally useful positions. But to “queer” is to upset the dialogic. At

     cusses Genesis P-Orridge’s body-transforming art and queering of gender.

the heart of both such positions is the negotiation of “otherness”: an otherness
that is made stable if celebrated or erased if integrated. Is an otherness so mas-
tered still an otherness? Are these the only two options? It will surprise none
that I do not have an answer to the question: I do however suspect that eso-
tericism’s mercurial heritage and contemporary diversity might signal more
confounding possibilities for the thinking of disciplinary identities and bound-
aries. So, even though, perhaps inherently unanswerable I will keep asking the
question as the range of possibilities will continue to trouble at least my own
conceptual predispositions.
   This last section, while introducing an increasingly prominent aspect of
gender analysis in esoteric discourse, ventured a little further afield in discuss-
ing disciplinary identity. This itself is an application of gender as a critical cat-
egory of inquiry wherein not only the gender of one’s specific objects of study
are considered, but also the gendered position of knowledges and disciplines.
The saucy taint of deviance remains an enduring marker of esoteric discourses
(both in general public discourse and academically). Perhaps it is time to trou-
ble – in deliciously unresolved ways – that condiment’s staple ingredients.
