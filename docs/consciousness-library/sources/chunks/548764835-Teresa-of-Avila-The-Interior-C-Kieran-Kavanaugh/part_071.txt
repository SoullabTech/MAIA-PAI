appointed you judge in this matter? The better they are the
more pleasing their praises will be to our Lord and the more
their prayer will profit their neighbor.
     In sum, my Sisters, what I conclude with is that we
shouldn't build castles in the air. The Lord doesn't look so
much at the greatness of our works as at the love with which
they are done. And if we do what we can, His Majesty will
enable us each day to do more and more, provided that we do
not quickly tire. But during the little while this life lasts-and
perhaps it will last a shorter time than each one thinks-let us
offer the Lord interiorly and exteriorly the sacrifice we can.
His Majesty will join it with that which He offered on the
cross to the Father for us. Thus even though our works are
small they will have the value our love for Him would have
merited had they been great.
     1 6. May it please His Majesty, my Sisters and daughters,
that we all reach that place where we may ever praise Him.
Through the merits of His Son who lives and reigns forever
and ever, may He give me the grace to carry out something of
what I tell you, amen. For I tell you that my confusion is great,
and thus I ask you through the same Lord that in your prayers
you do not forget this poor wretch.

      1. Although when I began writing this book I am sending
you I did so with the aversion I mentioned in the beginning, 2
now that I am finished I admit the work has brought me much
happiness, and I consider the labor, though I confess it was
small, well spent. Considering the strict enclosure and the few
things you have for your entertainment, my Sisters, and that
your buildings are not always as large as would be fitting for
your monasteries, I think it will be a consolation for you to
delight in this interior castle since without permission from the
prioress you can enter and take a walk through it at any time.
     2. True, you will not be able to enter all the dwelling
places through your own efforts, even though these efforts may
seem to you great, unless the Lord of the castle Himself brings
you there. Hence I advise you to use no force if you meet with
any resistance, for you will thereby anger Him in such a way
that He will never allow you to enter them. He is very fond of
humility. By considering that you do not deserve even to enter
the third you will more quickly win the favor to reach the fifth.
And you will be able to serve Him from there in such a way,
continuing to walk through them often, that He will bring you
into the very dwelling place He has for Himself. You need
never leave this latter dwelling place unless called by the
prioress, whose will this great Lord desires that you comply
with as much as if it were His own. Even though you are
frequently outside through her command, you will always find
the door open when you return. Once you get used to enjoying
this castle, you will find rest in all things, even those involving
much labor, for you will have the hope of returning to the
castle, which no one can take from you.

     3 . Although no more than seven dwelling places were
discussed, in each of these there are many others, below and
above and to the sides, with lovely gardens and fountains and
labyrinths, such delightful things that you would want to be
dissolved in praises of the great God who created the soul in
His own image and likeness.3 If you find something good in the
way I have explained this to you, believe that indeed His
Majesty said it so as to make you happy; the bad that you might
find is said by me.
     4. Through the strong desire I have to play some part in
helping you serve my God and Lord, I ask that each time you
read this work you, in my name, praise His Majesty fervently
and ask for the increase of His Church and for light for the
Lutherans. As for me, ask Him to pardon my sins and deliver
me from purgatory, for perhaps by the mercy of God I will be
there when this is given you to read-if it may be seen by you
after having been examined by learned men. If anything is
erroneous it is so because I didn't know otherwise; and I
submit in everything to what the holy Roman Catholic Church
holds, for in this Church I live, declare my faith, and promise
to live and die.
     May God our Lord be forever praised and blessed, amen,
amen.
      5. This writing was finished in the monastery of Saint
Joseph of Avila in the year 1 577, the eve before the feast of
Saint Andrew,4 for the glory of God who lives and reigns
forever and ever, amen.
