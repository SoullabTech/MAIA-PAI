2. The first effect is a forgetfulness of self, for truly the
soul, seemingly, no longer is, as was said.2 Everything is such
that this soul doesn't know or recall that there will be heaven
or life or honor for it, because it employs all it has in procuring
the honor of God. It seems the words His Majesty spoke to
her produced the deed in her. They were that she look after
what is His and that He would look after what is hers. 3
Thus, the soul doesn't worry about all that can happen. It
experiences strange forgetfulness, for, as I say, seemingly the
soul no longer is or would want to be anything in anything,
except when it understands that there can come from itself
something by which the glory and honor of God may increase
even one degree. For this purpose the soul would very willing­
ly lay down its life.
      3. Don't think by this, daughters, that a person fails to
remember to eat and sleep-doing so is no small torment-and
to do all that he is obliged to in conformity with his state in
life. We are speaking of interior matters, for there is little to say
about exterior works. Rather, the soul's pain lies in seeing that
what it can now do by its own efforts amounts to nothing. For
no earthly thing would it fail to do all it can and understands to
be for the service of our Lord.
      4. The second effect is that the soul has a great desire to
suffer, but not the kind of desire that disturbs it as previously.
For the desire left in these souls that the will of God be done in
them reaches such an extreme that they think everything His
Majesty does is good. If He desires the soul to suffer, well and
good; if not, it doesn't kill itself as it used to.
      5. These souls also have a deep interior joy when they are
persecuted, with much more peace than that mentioned, and
without any hostile feelings toward those who do, or desire to
do, them evil. On the contrary, such a soul gains a particular
love for its persecutors, in such a way that if it sees these latter
in some trial it feels compassion and would take on any burden
to free them from their trial, and eagerly recommends them to
God and would rejoice to lose the favors His Majesty grants it
if He would bestow these same gifts on those others so that
they wouldn't offend our Lord.
      6. You have already seen the trials and afflictions these
souls have experienced in order to die so as to enjoy our Lord.4

What surprises me most of all now is that they have just as
great a desire to serve Him and that through them He be
praised and that they may benefit some soul if they can. For
not only do they not desire to die but they desire to live very
many years suffering the greatest trials if through these they
can help that the Lord be praised, even though in something
very small. If they knew for certain that in leaving the body the
soul would enjoy God, they wouldn't pay attention to that; nor
do they think of the glory of the saints. They do not desire at
that time to be in glory. Their glory lies in being able some
way to help the Crucified, especially when they see He is so
offended and that few there are who, detached from everything
else, really look after His honor.
      7. It is true that sometimes these things are forgotten, and
the loving desires to enjoy God and leave this exile return,
especially when the soul sees how little it serves Him. But soon
it turns and looks within itself and at how continually it
experiences His presence, and with that it is content and offers
His Majesty the desire to live as the most costly offering it can
give Him.
     It has no more fear of death than it would of a gentle
rapture. The fact is that He who gave those desires that were so
excessive a torment now gives these others. May He be always
blessed and praised.
      8. The desires these souls have are no longer for conso­
lations or spiritual delight, since the Lord Himself is present
with these souls and it is His Majesty who now lives. Clearly,
His life was nothing but a continual torment, and He makes
ours the same; at least with the desires, for in other things He
leads us as the weak, although souls share much in His forti­
tude when He sees they have need of it.
     There is a great detachment from everything and a desire
to be always either alone or occupied in something that will
benefit some soul. There are no interior trials or feelings of
dryness, but the soul lives with a remembrance and tender love
of our Lord. It would never want to go without praising Him.
When it becomes distracted the Lord Himself awakens it in the
manner mentioned, 5 for one sees most clearly that that im­
pulse, or I don't know what to call the feeling, proceeds from
the interior depths of the soul, as was said of the impulses in
                                1 84

the previous dwelling place.6 Here, in this dwelling place,
these impulses are experienced most gently, but they do not
proceed from the mind or the memory, nor do they come from
anything that would make one think the soul did something on
its own. This experience is an ordinary and frequent one, for it
has been observed carefully. Just as a fire does not shoot its
flames downward but upward, however great a fire is enkin­
dled, so one experiences here that this interior movement
proceeds from the center of the soul and awakens the faculties.
     9. Certainly, if �here were no other gain in this way of
prayer except to understand the particular care God has in
communicating with us and beseeching us to remain with
Him-for this experience doesn't seem to be anything else-it
seems to me that all the trials endured for the sake of enjoying
these touches of His love, so gentle and penetrating, would be
well worthwhile.
     This you will have experienced, Sisters. For I think that
when one has reached the prayer of union the Lord goes about
with this concern if we do not grow negligent in keeping His
commandments. When this impulse comes to you, remember
that it comes from this interior dwelling place where God is in
our soul, and praise Him very much. For certainly that note or
letter is His, written with intense love and in such a way that
He wants you alone to understand it and what He asks of you
in it. By no means should you fail to respond to His Majesty,
even though you may be externally occupied or in conversation
with some persons. For it will often happen that our Lord will
want to grant you this secret favor in public, and it is very
easy-since the response is interior-to do what I'm saying and
make an act of love, or say what Saint Paul said: Lord, what will
You have me do?7 In many ways He will teach you there what
will be pleasing to Him and the acceptable time. I think it is
understood that He hears us, and this touch, which is so
delicate, almost always disposes the soul to be able to do what
was said with a resolute will.
      10. The difference in this dwelling place is the one men­
tioned:8 There are almost never any experiences of dryness or
interior disturbance of the kind that was present at times in all
the other dwelling places, but the soul is almost always in
quiet. There is no fear that this sublime favor can be counter-
