       I. She spoke of the prayer of recollection in various places: Life, chaps.
14-15; Way of Perfection, chaps. 28-29; Spiritual Testimonies, 59, no. 3. But
Teresa is not consistent in her terminology. Sometimes she speaks of a
recollection that is not infused (in the Way of Perf): at other times of a
recollection that is infused: in the Life, using the term indiscriminately with
"quiet" to designate the first degree of infused prayer, and in the Spiritual
Testimonies to designate the first faint experience of mystical prayer that
prepares the way for the prayer of quiet. See no. 8 of this chapter.
       2. She is alluding to works such as Osuna's Third Spiritual Alphabet, IX,
chap. 7; and Laredo's Ascent ofMount Sion, III, chap. 41. See Life, chap. 12, nos.

Chapter 4
      1. The prayer of union.
      2. Having begun this work in Toledo, June 2, 1 577, Teresa in less than
a month and a half had got as far as chapter three of the fifth dwelling place.
About the middle of July she moved to Avila where she probably wrote
chapter three. She then abandoned all work on her book until the beginning
of November. And by November 29, 1 577, her task was completed.
      3. In her comparison, Teresa makes use of the stages that were fol­
lowed in her day for the arrangement of a marriage: (1) meetings between the
young man and woman; (2) exchanging of gifts; (3) falling in love; (4) the
joining of hands; (5) betrothal; (6) marriage.

       4. She is referring to herself. See Life, chap. 28, no. 14.
       5. The "favor that was mentioned" is the prayer of union or the
"meetings" between the two who will be betrothed, the prayer characteristic
of the fifth dwelling place. The person Teresa refers to is her:self. "Forty
years ago" would have been 1 537. For an account of these sufferings and
trials see Life, chaps. 4-6; for her first experiences of union, see Life, chap. 4,
no. 7.

her assuring her that the prayer was good. For a description of her personal
experience of this grace see also her Life, chaps. 29 and 20.
      6. See nos. 1, 3, and 5. These favors proceed "from very deep within the

place," there, "where the Lord who is unchanging dwells."
