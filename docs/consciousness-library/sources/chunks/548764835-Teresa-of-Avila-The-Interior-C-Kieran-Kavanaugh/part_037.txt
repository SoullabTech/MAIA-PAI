ings. Some sufferings are produced suddenly by our human
nature, and the same goes for consolations, and even by the
charity of compassion for one's neighbor, as our Lord experi­
enced when He raised Lazarus.4 Being united with God's will
doesn't take these experiences away, nor do they disturb the
soul with a restless, disquieting passion that lasts a long while.
These sufferings pass quickly. As I have said concerning conso­
lations in prayer,5 it seems they do not reach the soul's depth
but only the senses and faculties. They are found in the previ­
ous dwelling places; but they do not enter the last ones still to
be explained, since the suspension of the faculties is necessary
in order to reach these, as has been said. 6 The Lord has the
power to enrich souls through many paths and bring them to
these dwelling places, without using the short cut that was
mentioned.
     5. Nonetheless, take careful note, daughters, that it is nec­
essary for the silkworm to die, and, moreover, at a cost to
yourselves. In the delightful union, 7 the experience of seeing
oneself in so new a life greatly helps one to die; in the other
union, 8 it's necessary that, while living in this life, we ourselves
put the silkworm to death. I confess this latter death will
require a great deal of effort, or more than that; but it has its
value. Thus if you come out victorious the reward will be
much greater. But there is no reason to doubt the possibility of
this death any more than that of true union with the will of
God. This union with God's will is the union I have desired all
my life; it is the union I ask the Lord for always and the one
that is clearest and safest.
     6. But alas for us, how few there must be who reach it,
although whoever guards himself against offending the Lord
and has entered religious life thinks he has done everything!
Oh, but there remain some worms, unrecognized until, like
those in the story of Jonah that gnawed away the ivy,9 they
have gnawed away the virtues. This happens through self-love,
self-esteem, judging one's neighbors, even though in little
things, a lack of charity for them, and not loving them as
ourselves. For even though, while crawling along, we fulfill
our obligation and no sin is committed, we don't advance very
far in what is required for complete union with the will of
God.

     7. What do you think His will is, daughters? That we be
completely perfect. See what we lack to be one with Him and
His Father as His Majesty asked. 1 0 I tell you I am writing this
with much pain upon seeing myself so far away-and all
through my own fault. The Lord doesn't have to grant us great
delights for this union; sufficient is what He has given us in
His Son, who would teach us the road. Don't think the matter
lies in my being so conformed to the will of God that if my
father or brother dies I don't feel it, or that if there are trials or
sicknesses I suffer them happily. Such an attitude is good, and
sometimes it's a matter of discretion because we can't do other­
wise, and we make a virtue of necessity. How many things like
these the philosophers did, or even, though not like these, other
things, such as acquiring much learning. Here in our religious
life the Lord asks of us only two things: love of His Majesty
and love of our neighbor. These are what we must work for. By
keeping them with perfection, we do His will and so will be
united with Him. But how far, as I have said, we are from
doing these two things for so great a God as we ought! May it
please His Majesty to give us His grace so that we might merit,
if we want, to reach this state that lies within our power.
     8. The most certain sign, in my opinion, as to whether or
not we are observing these two laws is whether we observe
well the love of neighbor. We cannot know whether or not we
love God, although there are strong indications for recognizing
that we do love Him; but we can know whether we love our
neighbor. 1 1 And be certain that the more advanced you s�ou
are in love for your neighbor the more advanced you will be in
the love of God, for the love His Majesty has for us is so great
that to repay us for our love of neighbor He will in a thousand
ways increase the love we have for Him. I cannot doubt this.
     9. It's important for us to walk with careful attention to
how we are proceeding in this matter, for if we practice love of
neighbor with great perfection, we will have done everything.
I believe that, since our nature is bad, we will not reach
perfection in the love of neighbor if that love doesn't rise from
love of God as its root. Since this is so important to us Sisters,
let's try to understand ourselves even in little things, and pay
no attention to any big plans that sometimes suddenly come to
us during prayer in which it seems we will do wonders for our
                                 100
                  THE INTERIOR CASTLE

neighbor and even for just one soul so that it may be saved. If
afterward our deeds are not in conformity with those plans,
there will be no reason to believe that we will accomplish the
plans. I say the same about humility and all the virtues. Great
are the wiles of the devil; to make us think we have one
virtue-when we don't-he would circle hell a thousand times.
And he is right because such a notion is very harmful, for these
feigned virtues never come without some vainglory since they
rise from that source, just as virtues from God are free of it as
well as of pride.
      1 0. I am amused sometimes to see certain souls who think
when they are at prayer that they would like to be humiliated
and publicly insulted for God, and afterward they would hide a
tiny fault if they could; or, if they have not committed one and
yet are charged with it-God deliver us! Well, let anyone who
can't bear such a thing be careful not to pay attention to what
he has by himself determined-in his opinion-to do. As a
 matter of fact, the determination was not in the will-for when
 there is a true determination of the will it's another matter-but
 a work of the imagination; it is in the imagination that the devil
produces his wiles and deceits. And with women or unlearned
people he can produce a great number, for we don't know how
the faculties differ from one another and from the imagination,
 nor do we know about a thousand other things there are in
regard to interior matters. 0 Sisters, how clearly one sees the
degree to which love of neighbor is present in some of you, and
how clearly one sees the deficiency in those who lack such
perfection! If you were to understand how important this
virtue is for us you wouldn't engage in any other study.
      1 1 . When I see souls very earnest in trying to understand
the prayer they have and very sullen when they are in it-for it
seems they don't dare let their minds move or stir lest a bit of
their spiritual delight and devotion be lost-it makes me realize
how little they understand of the way by which union is
attained; they think the whole matter lies in these things. No,
Sisters, absolutely not; works are what the Lord wants! He
desires that if you see a Sister who is sick to whom you can
bring some relief, you have compassion on her and not worry
about losing this devotion; and that if she is suffering pain, you
also feel it; and that, if necessary, you fast so that she might
