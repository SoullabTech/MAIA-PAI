so surrendered that it neither knows nor wants anything more
than what He wants with her (for God will never, in my
j udgment, grant this favor save to a soul that He takes for His
own), He desires that, without its understanding how, it may
go forth from this union impressed with His seal. For indeed
the soul does no more in this union than does the wax when
another impresses a seal on it. The wax doesn't impress the seal
upon itself; it is only disposed-! mean by being soft. And even
in order to be disposed it doesn't soften itself but remains still
and gives its consent. 0 goodness of God; everything must be
at a cost to You! All You want is our will and that there be no
impediment in the wax.
      1 3. Well now, you see here, Sisters, what our God does in
this union so that this soul may recognize itself as His own. He
gives from what He has, which is what His Son had in this life.
He cannot grant us a higher favor. Who could have had a
greater desire to leave this life? And so His Majesty said at the
Last Supper: I have earnestly desired. 1 1
     Well then, how is it, Lord, that You weren't thinking of
the laborious death You were about to suffer, so painful and
frightful? You answer: "No, my great love and the desire I
have that souls be saved are incomparably more important than
these sufferings; and the very greatest sorrows that I have
suffered and do suffer, after being in the world, are not enough
to be considered anything at all in comparison with this love
and desire to save souls."
      14. This is true, for I have often reflected on the matter. I
know the torment a certain soul of my acquaintance12 suffers
 and has suffered at seeing our Lord offended. The pain is so
unbearable that she desires to die much more than to suffer it.
If a soul with so little charity when compared with Christ's­
for its charity could be then considered almost nonexistent­
felt this torment to be so unbearable, what must have been the
feeling of our Lord Jesus Christ? And what kind of life must
He have suffered since all things were present to Him and He
was always witnessing the serious offenses committed against
 His Father? I believe without a doubt that these sufferings
were much greater than were those of His most sacred Passion.
At the time of His Passion He already saw an end to these trials
and with this awareness as well as the happiness of seeing a
                                96

remedy for us in His death and of showing us the love He had
for His Father in suffering so much for Him, He tempered His
sorrows. These sorrows are also tempered here below by those
who with the strength that comes from love perform great
penances, for they almost don't feel them; rather they would
want to do more and more-and everything they do seems
little to them. Well, what must it have been for His Majesty to
find Himself with so excellent an occasion for showing His
Father how completely obedient He was to Him, and with love
for His neighbor? 0 great delight, to suffer in doing the will of
God! But I consider it so difficult to see the many offenses
committed so continually against His Majesty and the many
souls going to hell that I believe only one day of that pain
would have been sufficient to end many lives; how much more
one life, if He had been no more than man.

                        CHAPTER THREE
     Continues on the same subject. Tells about another kind of union
the soul can reach with God � help and of how important love of
neighbor is for this union. The chapter fs very useful.
      1 . Well now let us get back to our little dove1 and see
something about what God gives it in this state. It must always
be understood that one has to strive to go forward in the
service of our Lord and in self-knowledge. For if a person does
no more than receive this favor and if, as though already
securely in possession of something, he grows careless in his
life and turns aside from the heavenly path, which consists of
keeping the commandments, that which happens to the silk­
worm will happen to him. For it gives forth the seed that
produces other silkworms, and itself dies forever. I say that it
"gives forth the seed" because I hold that it is God's desire that
a favor so great not be given in vain; if a person doesn't himself
benefit, the favor will benefit others. For since the soul is left
with these desires and virtues that were mentioned, it always
brings profit to other souls during the time that it continues to
live virtuously; and they catch fire from its fire. And even
when the soul has itself lost this fire, the inclination to benefit
others will remain, and the soul delights in explaining the
favors God grants to whoever loves and serves Him.

     2. I know a person to whom this happened. 2 Although she
had gone far astray, she enjoyed helping others through the
favors God had granted her and showing the way of prayer to
those who didn't understand it; and she did a great deal of
good. Afterward the Lord again gave her light. It's true that
she still hadn't experienced the effects that were mentioned;
but how many there must be, like Judas, whom the Lord calls
to the apostolate by communing with them, and, like Saul,
whom He calls to be kings, who afterward through their own
fault go astray! Thus we can conclude, Sisters, that, in order to
merit more and more and to avoid getting lost like such per­
sons, our security lies in obedience and refusal to deviate from
God's law. I'm speaking to those to whom He has granted
similar favors, and even to everyone.
     3 . It seems to me that despite all I've said about this
dwelling place, the matter is still somewhat obscure. Since so
much gain comes from entering this place, it will be good to
avoid giving the impression that those to whom the Lord
doesn't give things that are so supernatural are left without
hope. True union can very well be reached, with God's help, if
we make the effort to obtain it by keeping our wills fixed only
on that which is God's will. Oh, how many of us there are who
will say we do this, and it will seem to us that we don't want
anything else and that we would die for this truth, as I believe I
have saidP Well I tell you, and I will often repeat it, that if
what you say is true you will have obtained this favor from the
Lord, and you needn't care at all about the other delightful
union that was mentioned. That which is most valuable in the
delightful union is what proceeds from this union of which I'm
now speaking; and one cannot arrive at the delightful union if
the union coming from being resigned to God's will is not very
certain. Oh, how desirable is this union with God's will! Hap­
py the soul that has reached it. Such a soul will live tranquilly
in this life, and in the next as well. Nothing in earthly events
afflicts it unless it finds itself in some danger of losing God or
sees that He is offended: neither sickness, nor poverty, nor
death-unless the death is of someone who will be missed by
God's Church-for this soul sees well that the Lord knows
what He is doing better than it knows what it is desiring.
     4. You must note that there are different kinds of suffer-
