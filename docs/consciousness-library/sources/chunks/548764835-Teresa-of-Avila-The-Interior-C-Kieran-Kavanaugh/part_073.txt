THE THIRD DWELLING PLACES

Chapter 1
      1. Ps. 1 1 2 : 1 .
      2. Teresa commissioned Fr. Jerome Gratian t o review her work. Gra­
tian did so scrupulously and made corrections here and there throughout the
manuscript. For example, in this passage he crossed out the word "secure"


                                         201
                                   NOTES

and substituted "right." In fact this whole chapter has a number of correc­
tions by Gratian who was fearful lest the Saint affirm any certitude about the
state of grace, or security about one's own salvation, that would have gone
contrary to the teaching of the Council of Trent or have been similar to
certain theories of the Alumbrados. Fortunately, Gratian made the deletion
marks so as to leave the original completely legible. The Jesuit Ribera, in
turn, corrected Gratian's corrections with marginal comments such as the
following: "One doesn't have to cross out any of the holy Mother's words." A
further example of the skirmish that went on in the margins of Teresa's
manusc:dpt can be found in no. 8 of this chapter. In that delicate passage
Teresa wrote: "Shouldn't we consider ourselves lucky to be able to repay
something of what we owe Him for His service toward us? I say these words
'His service toward us' unwillingly; but the fact is that He did nothing else
but serve us all the time He lived in this world." Gratian changed "His
service toward us" to "having died for us" and crossed out what followed.
Ribera again noted: "Nothing should be deleted; what the Saint said has been
very well said." All of this led to Ribera's written admonition on the first
page of the autograph of The Interior Castle: "What the holy Mother wrote in
this book is frequently crossed out, and other words are added or a gloss is
made in the margin. Usually the cancellation is poorly conceived and the text
is better the way it was first written . . . . And since I have read and looked
over this work with a certain amount of care, I think I should advise anyone
reading it to read it as the holy Mother wrote it, for she understood and said
things better, and to pay no attention to what was added or changed unless
the correction was made by the Saint herself in her own hand, which is
seldom. And I ask out of charity anyone who reads this book to reverence the
words and letters formed by so holy a hand and try to understand her
correctly; and you will see that there is nothing to correct. Even if you do not
understand, believe that she who wrote it knew better and that the words
cannot be corrected well unless their meaning is fully understood. If their
meaning is not grasped, what is very appropriately said will seem inappropri­
ate. Such is the way books are ruined and lost."

THE FOURTH      DWELLING      PLACES
Chapter   1
       I . Teresa used the Spanish word contentos (here rendered in English as
consolations) to denote experiences (such as joy, peace, satisfaction) that are
not infused; that is, experiences perceived as a result of prayer and virtue but
similar to those derived from everyday events. On the other hand, she uses
the Spanish word gustos (here rendered in English as spiritual delights) to de­
note infused experiences. Infused, "supernatural," or mystical prayer begins
in these fourth dwelling places with the prayer of infused recollection (chap.
3) and quiet, or spiritual delight (chap. 2). Actually Teresa presents the fourth
dwelling places as a stage of transition in which the natural and the supernat­
ural (or the acquired and the infused) are intermingled.
       2. In her Life. She is alluding to the many chapters there that deal with
mystical experiences. See chaps. 14-32 and 37-40. When Teresa wrote the Life
she had not yet come to the stage she describes in the seventh dwelling places.
What she explains in her Life under the symbol of the fourth water corre­
sponds to the sixth dwelling places. As a result, she points out that she has a
better understanding of some matters concerning the spiritual life than she
did in that book. See I, chap. 2, no. 7; IV, chap. 2, no. 5.
       3 . Allusion to Mt. 20: 1 3 . The absolute divine freedom in the granting
or denying of mystical favors is frequently insisted on in Teresa's writings.
In this work see IV, chap. 2, no. 9; V, chap. 1, no. 1 2; VI, chap. 4, no. 1 2; chap.

      9. One of Teresa's cherished maxims. See the Foundations, chap. 5, no. 2.
     10. We do not know who the learned man was. Some suggest that it may
have been Saint John of the Cross, who was Teresa's director and confessor
from 1 572-1 575. But Teresa's ignorance of the difference between the imagi­
nation (pensamiento, or mind, as she often refers to it) and the intellect was not
total ignorance. See Life, chap. 17, no. 5.

     I I . For many years this wandering of the mind deeply troubled the
Saint. See Life, chap. I7, no. 7; Way of Perfection, chap. 3 1 , no. 8. In this work
she has come to a definite doctrinal position on the matter. The instability
and rebellion of the imagination is a consequence of the disorder produced in
us through original sin. See no. I I of this chapter.
