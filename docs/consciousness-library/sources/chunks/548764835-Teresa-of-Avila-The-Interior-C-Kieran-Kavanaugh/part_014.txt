which this experience occurs, a spiritual profundity previously
unrevealed, in "the extreme interior, in some place very deep
within itself." 104 Though the presence of the Trinity remains
and is felt habitually, it is not revealed in the fullness of light as
at first or sometimes afterward when the Lord "desires that the
window of the intellect be opened."1 05 What seems awesome is
that the habitual intellectual vision of the Trinity does not
interfere with multiple and diverse daily duties carried out as
acts of service.
      The grace of spiritual marriage, of perfect union, is be­
stowed also in this center dwelling place and occurs through an
imaginative vision of the Lord's most sacred humanity "so that
the soul will understand and not be ignorant of receiving this
sovereign gift."106 The vision was so much at variance with
previous ones that it left Teresa "stupefied," for as does the
vision of the Trinity, this takes place in that most interior
depth of the spirit. In successive experiences of this grace,
which is repeatable, the vision is an intellectual one. Suggest­
ing the trait of inseparability, the term marriage designates the
union and the degree of His Majesty's love. It is so great and
reaches such a point that the spirit is made one with God "just
as those who are married cannot be separated."107 With no
allowance for division, as there is in spiritual betrothal (likened
to the joining and separation of the two candles), the union of
spiritual marriage makes Teresa think of the rain that has
fallen into a river or of a stream that enters the sea or of the
beams of light entering a room through different windows and
becoming one. 1 08
      At this point the butterfly dies with the greatest joy be­
cause its new life is Christ. In Saint Paul's words: "He that is
joined or united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him," and
"for me to live is Christ."109 The ultimate goal, then, of Tere­
sa's journey, the spiritual marriage, is a union with Jesus incar­
nate, now no longer living as the divine Logos but as the Word
incarnate, risen and connotated by the attributes of His earthly
adventure, especially those of His resurrection. With the pass­
 ing of time, the soul understands more clearly that its life is
Christ.
      Having examined the effects of this union, Teresa in the
final chapter explains that the purpose of all these splendid
                                  28

favors is that one might live like Christ and that the fruit of the
spiritual marriage must be good works. The interior calm
fortifies these persons so that they may endure much less calm
in the exterior events of their lives, that they might have the
strength to serve. 1 10 The works of service may be outstanding
ones, as in Teresa's case, but they need not be. One must
concentrate on serving those who are in one's company. "The
Lord doesn't look so much at the greatness of our works as at
the love with which they are done." His Majesty will join our
sacrifice with that which He offered for us. "Thus even though
our works are small they will have the value our love for Him
would have merited had they been great." 1 1 1

                       THE AUTOGRAPH
     The Interior Castle was not revised by Teresa, although the
manuscript does contain the marks of censors and learned men.
Some of these insertions of censors were later canceled by
others who disagreed.
     Teresa gave the new book to Fr. Gratian to guard, for the
Book ofHer Life was still at the Inquisition. Gratian brought the
work to Seville in 1 580 and entrusted it for safekeeping to
Maria de San Jose. Sometime between 1 582 and 1 585, while he
was still provincial, Gratian gave the work as a gift to Don
Pedro Cerezo Pardo, who was a generous benefactor of the
Discalced Carmelites. Between 1 586 and 1 588 the autograph
was in the hands of Fray Luis de Leon, who was at the time
preparing the first edition of Teresa's works; it was then re­
turned to Don Pedro Cerezo. In 1 6 1 8 Don Pedro's daughter,
Dona Constancia de Ayala, made her profession of vows in the
monastery of the Discalced Carmelite nuns in Seville. She had
brought with her to the Carmel the autograph of the Interior
Castle, and it has remained with the nuns in Seville ever since,
with one exception. In 1961 it was brought to Rome for repair,
and in the following year, beautifully restored, the spiritual
masterpiece was returned to the Carmelites in Seville. The red­
bound book, referred to by its author as a jewel, is now set like
a ruby in a reliquary that has walls like those of Avila and in
the shape of a castle surrounding and protecting it. 1 1 2

                           [PROLOGUE]
   Teresa ofjesus, a nun of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, wrote this
treatise for her Sisters and daughters, the Discalced Carmelite nuns.
      1 . Not many things that I have been ordered to do under
obedience have been as difficult for me as is this present task of
writing about prayer. First, it doesn't seem that the Lord is
giving me either the spirit or the desire to undertake the work.
Second, I have been experiencing now for three months such
great noise and weakness in my head that I've found it a
hardship even to write concerning necessary business matters.
But, knowing that the strength given by obedience usually
lessens the difficulty of things that seem impossible, I resolved
to carry out the task very willingly, even though my human
nature seems greatly distressed. For the Lord hasn't given me
so much virtue that my nature in the midst of its struggle with
continual sickness and duties of so many kinds doesn't feel
strong aversion toward such a task. May He, in whose mercy I
trust and who has helped me in other more difficult things so
as to favor me, do this work for me.
      2. Indeed, I don't think I have much more to say than what
I've said in other things they have ordered me to write; 1 rather,
I fear that the things I write about will be nearly all alike. I'm,
literally, just like the parrots that are taught to speak; they
know no more than what they hear or are shown, and they
often repeat it. If the Lord wants me to say something new, His
