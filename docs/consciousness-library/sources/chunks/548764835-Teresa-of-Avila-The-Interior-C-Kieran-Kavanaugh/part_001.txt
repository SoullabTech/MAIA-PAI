                   Acknowledgments


     We are happy to acknowledge our indebtedness to all those
who have urged us on in the preparation of this work. The In­
stitute of Carmelite Studies has given us support and provided
us with necessary materials otherwise unobtainable in libraries
in the United States. A special expression of gratitude must go
to Fr. Tomas Alvarez for his Spanish edition of the complete
works of St. Teresa. His punctuation of the text and many foot­
notes were an important help to us in working with difficult
passages. Many of our own notes, with his kind consent, are
based on or taken exactly from his edition. We are grateful as
well to Fr. Adrian J. Cooney and Sr. Mary Elizabeth Stanton
for their suggestions and assistance and to our typist Jean
Mallon.
