even after this she didn't believe him and asked others who told
her the truth, with which she was greatly consoled. 15
     10. Don't be mistaken by thinking that this certitude has
to do with a corporal form, as in the case of the bodily presence
of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Most Blessed Sacrament even
though we do not see Him. Here the matter isn't like that; it
concerns only the divinity. How, then, is it that what we do
not see leaves this certitude? I don't know; these are His works.
But I do know I speak the truth. And I would say that whoever
does not receive this certitude does not experience union of the
whole soul with God, but .union of some faculty, or that he
experiences one of the many other kinds of favors God grants
souls. In regard to all these favors we have to give up looking
for reasons to see how they've come about. Since our intellect
cannot understand this union, why do we have to make this
effort? It's enough for us to see that He who is the cause of it is
almighty. Since we have no part at all to play in bringing it
about no matter how much effort we put forth, but it is God
who does so, let us not desire the capacity to understand this
union.
     1 1 . Now I recall, in saying that we have no part to play,
what you have heard the Bride say in the Song of Songs: He
brought me into the wine cellar (or, placed me there, I believe it
says).16 And it doesn't say that she went. And she says also that
she went looking about in every part of the city for her Be­
loved. 17 I understand this union to be the wine cellar where the
Lord wishes to place us when He desires and as He desires. But
however great the effort we make to do so, we cannot enter.
His Majesty must place us there and enter Himself into the
center of our soul. And that He may show His marvels more
clearly, He doesn't want our will to have any part to play, for it
has been entirely surrendered to Him. Neither does He want
the door of the faculties and of the senses to be opened, for they
are all asleep. But He wants to enter the center of the soul
without going through any door, as He entered the place
where His disciples were when He said pax vobis;1 8 or as He left
the tomb without lifting away the stone. Further on you will
see in the last dwelling place19 ho� His Majesty desires that
the soul enjoy Him in its own center even much more than
here.

     1 2 . 0 daughters, how much we shall see if we don't want
to have anything more to do with our own lowliness and
misery and if we understand that we are unworthy of being
servants of a Lord who is so great we cannot comprehend His
wonders! May He be forever praised, amen.

                            CHAPTER TWO
     Continues on the same topic. Explains the prayer of union through
an exquisite comparison. Tells about the effects it leaves in the soul. The
chapter is very important.
      1 . It will seem to you that everything has already been said
about what there is to see in this dwelling place. Yet a lot is
missing; for, as I said,1 there are various degrees of intensity.
With regard to the nature of union, I don't believe I'd know
how to say anything more. But when souls to whom God
grants these favors prepare themselves, there are many things
to say about the Lord's work in them. I shall speak of some of
these and tell about the state the soul is left in. To explain
things better I want to use a helpful comparison; it is good for
making us see how, even though we can do nothing in this
work done by the Lord, we can do much by disposing ourselves
so that His Majesty may grant us this favor.
      2. You must have already heard about His marvels mani­
fested in the way silk originates, for only He could have invent­
ed something like that. The silkworms come from seeds about
the size of little grains of pepper. (I have never seen this but
have heard of it, and so if something in the explanation gets
distorted it won't be my fault.) When the warm weather comes
and the leaves begin to appear on the mulberry tree, the seeds
start to live, for they are dead until then. The worms nourish
themselves on the mulberry leaves until, having grown to full
size, they settle on some twigs. There with their little mouths
they themselves go about spinning the silk and making some
very thick little cocoons in which they enclose themselves. The
silkworm, which is fat and ugly, then dies, and a little white
butterfly, which is very pretty, comes forth from the cocoon.
Now if this were not seen but recounted to us as having
happened in other times, who would believe it? Or what rea­
sonings could make us conclude that a thing as nonrational as a
                                    91
                     TERESA OF AVILA

worm or a bee could be so diligent in working for our benefit
and with so much industriousness? And the poor little worm
loses its life in the challenge. This is enough, Sisters, for a
period of meditation even though I may say no more to you; in
it you can consider the wonders and the wisdom of our God.
Well now, what would happen if we knew the property of
every created thing? It is very beneficial for us to busy our­
selves thinking of these grandeurs and delighting in being
brides of a King so wise and powerful.
     3. Let's return to what I was saying. This silkworm, then,
starts to live when by the heat of the Holy Spirit it begins to
benefit through the general help given to us all by God and
through the remedies left by Him to His Church, by going to
confession, reading good books, and hearing sermons, which
are the remedies that a soul, dead in its carelessness and sins
and placed in the midst of occasions, can make use of. It then
begins to live and to sustain itself by these things, and by good
meditations, until it is grown. Its being grown is what is
relevant to what I'm saying, for these other things have little
importance here.
     4. Well once this silkworm is grown-in the beginning I
dealt with its growth2-it begins to spin the silk and build the
house wherein it will die. I would like to point out here that
this house is Christ. Somewhere, it seems to me, I have read or
heard that our life is hidden in Christ or in God (both are the
same), or that our life is Christ. 3 Whether the quotation is exact
or not doesn't matter for what I intend.
     5. Well see here, daughters, what we can do through the
help of God: His Majesty Himself, as He does in this prayer of
 union, becomes the dwelling place we build for ourselves. It
seems I'm saying that we can build up God and take Him away
since I say that He is the dwelling place and we ourselves can
build it so as to place ourselves in it. And, indeed, we can! Not
that we can take God away or build Him up, but we can take
away from ourselves and build up, as do these little silkworms.
For we will not have finished doing all that we can in this work
when, to the little we do, which is nothing, God will unite
 Himself, with His greatness, and give it such high value that
the Lord Himself will become the reward of this work. Thus,
since it was He who paid the highest price, His Majesty wants
