brilliance. Nothing helps such a soul, and as a result all the
good works it might do while in mortal sin are fruitless for the
attainment of glory. Since these works do not proceed from
that principle, which is God, who is the cause of our virtue's
being really virtue, and are separated from Him, they cannot
be pleasing in His sight. Since, after all, the intention of
anyone who commits a mortal sin is to please the devil, not
God, the poor soul becomes darkness itself because the devil is
darkness itself.
      2. I know a person to whom our Lord wanted to show
what a soul in mortal sin was like.2 That person says that in her
opinion if this were understood it would be impossible to sin,
even though a soul would have to undergo the greatest trials
imaginable in order to flee the occasions. So the Lord gave her
a strong desire that all might understand this. May He give
you, daughters, the desire to beseech Him earnestly for those
who are in this state, w�o have become total darkness, and
whose works have become darkness also. For j ust as all the
streams that flow from a crystal-clear fount are also clear, the
works of a soul in grace, because they proceed from this fount
of life in which the soul is planted like a tree, are most pleasing
in the eyes of both God and man. There would be no freshness,
no fruit, if it were not for this fount sustaining the tree,
preventing it from drying up, and causing it to produce good
fruit. Thus in the case of a soul that through its own fault
withdraws from this fount and plants itself in a place where
the water is black and foul smelling, everything that flows
from it is equally wretched and filthy.
      3. It should be kept in mind here that the fount, the
shining sun that is in the center of the soul, does not lose its
beauty and splendor; it is always present in the soul, and
nothing can take away its loveliness. But if a black cloth is
placed over a crystal that is in the sun, obviously the sun's
brilliance will have no effect on the crystal even though the
 sun is shining on it. 3
     4. 0 souls redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ! Under­
stand and take pity on yourselves. How is it possible that in
realizing these things you don't strive to remove the pitch from
this crystal? See that if your life comes to an end you will never
again enjoy this light. 0 Jesus, how sad a thing it is to see a soul

separated from this light! How miserable is the state of those
poor rooms within the castle! How disturbed the senses are,
that is, the people who live in these rooms! And in the faculties,
that is, among the custodians, the stewards, and the chief
waiters, what blindness, what bad management! In sum, since
the tree is planted where the devil is, what fruit can it bear?
     5. I once heard of a spiritual man who was not surprised at
things done by a person in mortal sin, but at what was not
done. May God in His mercy deliver us from so great an evil.
There is nothing, while we are living, that deserves this name
"evil" except mortal sin, for such sin carries in its wake ever­
lasting evils. This, daughters, is what we must go about in fear
of and what we must ask God in our prayers to protect us
against. For if He doesn't guard the city, our labor will be in
vain,4 since we are vanity itself.
     That person I mentioned5 said she received two blessings
from the favor God granted her: the first, an intense fear of
offending Him, and so in seeing such terrible dangers she
always went about begging Him not to let her fall; the second,
a mirror for humility, in which she saw how none of our good
deeds has its principle in ourselves but in this fount in which
the tree, symbolizing our souls, is planted and in this sun that
gives warmth to our works. She says that this truth was repre­
sented to her so clearly that in doing something good, or seeing
it done, she gave heed to the source and understood how
without this help we could do nothing. As a result she would
begin immediately to praise God and usually not think of
herself in any good thing that she did.
     6. The time you spend in reading this, or I in writing it,
Sisters, would not be lost if we were left with these two
blessings. Learned and wise men know about these things very
well, but everything is necessary for our womanly dullness of
mind; and so perhaps the Lord wills that we get to know
comparisons like these. May it please His goodness to give us
grace to profit by them.
     7. These interior matters are so obscure for our minds that
anyone who knows as little as I will be forced to say many
superfluous and even foolish things in order to say something
that's right. Whoever reads this must have patience, for I have
to have it in order to write about what I don't know. Indeed,
                                41
                     TERESA OF AVILA

sometimes I take up the paper like a simpleton, for I don't
know what to say or how to begin. I understand well that it's
important for you that I explain some things about the interior
life as best I can. We always hear about what a good thing
prayer is, and our constitutions oblige us to spend so many
hours in prayer.6 Yet only what we ourselves can do in prayer
is explained to us; little is explained about what the Lord does
in a soul, I mean about the supernatural.' By speaking about
this heavenly interior building and explaining and considering
it in many ways we shall find great comfort. It is so little
understood by mortals, even though many walk through it.
And although in other things I've written the Lord has given
me some understanding, 8 I know there were certain things I
had not understood as I have come to understand them now,
especially certain more difficult things. The trouble is that
before discussing them, as I have said,9 I will have to repeat
matters that are well known; on account of my stupidity things
can't be otherwise.
      8. Well now let's get back to our castle with its many
dwelling places. You mustn't think of these dwelling places in
such a way that each one would follow in file after the other;
but turn your eyes toward the center, which is the room or
royal chamber where the King stays, and think of how a
palmetto10 has many leaves surrounding and covering the tasty
part that can be eaten. So here, surrounding this center room
are many other rooms; and the same holds true for those above.
The things of the soul must always be considered as plentiful,
spacious, and large; to do so is not an exaggeration. The soul is
capable of much more than we can imagine, and the sun that is
in this royal chamber shines in all parts. It is very important
for any soul that practices prayer, whether little or much, not
to hold itself back and stay in one corner. Let it walk through
these dwelling places which are up above, down below, and to
the sides, since God has given it such great dignity. Don't force
it to stay a long time in one room alone. Oh, but if it is in the
room of self-knowledge! How necessary this room is-see that
you understand me-even for those whom the Lord has
brought into the very dwelling place where He abides. For
never, however exalted the soul may be, is anything else more
fitting than self-knowledge; nor could it be even were the soul
