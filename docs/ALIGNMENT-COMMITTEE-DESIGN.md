# Soullab Alignment Committee - Design

## Purpose

**Not a traditional advisory board** (focused on business growth)
**An alignment committee** focused on: Are we living our values?

**Core mandate:**
- Review alignment metrics quarterly
- Challenge decisions that might compromise member sovereignty
- Hold Kelly accountable to stated values
- Provide external perspective on drift that's hard to see from inside

---

## How It Works

### Quarterly Reviews (4x/year)

**Materials provided in advance:**
- Alignment dashboard report (from metrics)
- Major product/business decisions made
- User feedback summary (autonomy/dependency signals)
- Any concerning metric trends
- Kelly's reflection on the quarter

**90-minute meeting:**
- 15 min: Kelly presents state of alignment
- 45 min: Committee reviews data, asks questions
- 30 min: Recommendations and action items

**Output:**
- Written summary of committee assessment
- Recommendations (non-binding but public)
- Any flags/concerns for next quarter
- Published publicly (transparency)

### Ad-Hoc Reviews (as needed)

**Triggered by:**
- Major product decisions affecting member experience
- Autonomy scores declining >10%
- Dependency rate exceeding 20%
- Cost-driven decisions that impact quality
- User reports of harm

**Process:**
- Kelly requests review OR committee member calls meeting
- Expedited review (within 2 weeks)
- Committee can recommend pause/rollback

### Annual Deep Dive

**Once per year:**
- Full day session
- Review annual trends
- Strategic alignment check
- Update metrics if needed
- Refresh committee membership if rotating

## Powers & Limitations

### What Committee CAN Do:

✓ **Review** all alignment data
✓ **Question** any business/product decision
✓ **Recommend** changes publicly
✓ **Flag** concerns that need addressing
✓ **Request** additional data/metrics
✓ **Publish** their assessments (transparency)
✓ **Escalate** to public if major misalignment ignored

### What Committee CANNOT Do:

✗ **Veto** business decisions (Kelly retains authority)
✗ **Manage** day-to-day operations
✗ **Fire** Kelly or override governance
✗ **Represent** Soullab publicly without permission

### The Balance:

**Kelly's commitment:**
"I will seriously consider all committee recommendations. If I choose not to follow a recommendation, I will explain why publicly."

**Committee's power:**
Moral authority + transparency. If Kelly consistently ignores concerning recommendations, committee can make that public.

**The nuclear option:**
If committee unanimously believes Soullab has become net-harmful and Kelly won't change course, they can:
1. Publish dissent
2. Resign publicly with explanation
3. Recommend users consider alternatives

This is reputational accountability, not legal control.

## Compensation

### Paid vs Volunteer?

**Recommendation: Pay them**

**Why:**
- Signals you value their work
- Allows people who aren't wealthy to participate
- Creates professional obligation (not just favor)
- Typical: $5-10k/year for quarterly commitment

**Exception: Member representative**
- Could be unpaid (conflict if paid by platform they're meant to critique)
- Or: Compensated but with clear firewall

---

## Finding the Right People

### What to Look For:

**✓ Independence**
- Can challenge you without fear
- Not financially dependent on Soullab success
- Willing to resign if values compromised

**✓ Expertise**
- Deep knowledge in their domain
- Track record of integrity
- Understanding of the work

**✓ Alignment with Values**
- Get the mission (not just "AI is cool")
- Care about human sovereignty
- Suspicious of extractive tech

**✓ Diversity**
- Different backgrounds/perspectives
- Not all from same bubble
- Mix of ages, experiences

### Red Flags:

**✗ Too close to you**
- Friends who won't challenge you
- People who need the gig
- Cheerleaders, not critics

**✗ Wrong incentives**
- VCs who want growth at all costs
- Consultants selling services
- Competitors gathering intel

**✗ Wrong expertise**
- "AI expert" with no consciousness background
- Business advisor with no ethics focus
- Theorist with no practical grounding

## Charter Template

### Soullab Alignment Committee Charter

**Mission:**
Hold Soullab accountable to its stated values of serving authentic becoming and member sovereignty.

**Principles:**
1. Members' authentic becoming > business growth
2. Autonomy > engagement
3. Transparency > reputation management
4. Long-term integrity > short-term success

**Commitments:**

*Kelly's commitments:*

- Seriously consider all recommendations
- Explain publicly if recommendations not followed
- Never retaliate against critical feedback

*Committee commitments:*
- Review data thoroughly and fairly
- Ask hard questions from place of support
- Focus on values alignment, not business advice

**Public Transparency:**

## Why This Works

### Schmachtenberger's Test Applied:

**Question**: "Would you shut down if proven harmful?"

**With committee**:
- You have external people watching the data
- They can call out when data shows harm
- You've **pre-committed** to listening
- If you ignore them, they can make it public

**This is architectural accountability**, not just good intentions.

### The Power:

Not legal control. **Reputational commitment.**

If you build reputation on "we're different, we're accountable" and then ignore your alignment committee's unanimous concerns... that's public proof you're not different.

The committee makes your claims **falsifiable**.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Identify 2-3 initial members** (start small)
2. **Draft simple charter** (1-page, the essentials)
3. **Schedule first quarterly** (even if metrics are rough)
4. **Iterate** based on what you learn

**Key:** Don't over-design. Start simple, evolve.

The act of **having** an alignment committee sends a signal:
"We're serious about this. We're inviting scrutiny."

That alone differentiates you from 99% of AI companies.
