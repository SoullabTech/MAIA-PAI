## JOURNEY SCRIPT

### OPENING & SETUP (4-5 minutes)

Welcome. I'm so glad you're here.

Before we begin, let's create a safe container for this work. Find a comfortable position - seated or lying down, whatever feels right for your body right now.

Take a deep breath with me... and release.

Good.

Now, I want you to imagine - just off to your left - there's a beautiful box. This is your energy conversion box. Any energy that doesn't serve you, any tension, any worry... you can place it in this box. And the box transforms that energy into something useful - compost for the garden of your soul.

So let's take a moment... what are you carrying that you can set down right now? Just notice it... and place it in the box.

Good.

Now, let's ground. I want you to imagine roots growing from the base of your spine, deep into the earth. Down, down, down... through soil and stone... finding the molten core of the earth. That fire at the center.

And as you touch that core, feel the earth's energy rising up through your roots... up your spine... filling your body with warmth and support.

It is so. It is so. It is so.

Now, bring your awareness to your belly. Your water center. The ocean inside you. Notice the tides there... the currents of emotion. We're going to honor the water element, because water teaches us to flow, to feel, to dissolve and reform.

Breathe into your belly... let the waters be calm.

Good.

Bring your awareness to your heart. Your fire center. The sun inside your chest. This is your creative fire, your passion, your life force. Feel it glowing there.

And now, your throat. Your air center. The wind of your voice, your truth, your expression. Notice the breath moving through.

And finally, the crown of your head. Your aether center. Where you connect to something larger than yourself - spirit, cosmos, the divine intelligence that breathes through all things.

You are grounded. You are held. You are protected.

Now, I want you to imagine a circle of light around you. And standing at the edges of this circle are your guides - the ones who love you unconditionally. They might be ancestors, spirit animals, angels, archetypes... just notice who shows up.

They're here to witness this work with you. You are not alone.

It is so.

### THE JOURNEY BEGINS (8-10 minutes)

Now, let's soft-eye this Inner Critic you've been carrying.

I want you to bring to mind that voice inside - the one that says you're not enough, that criticizes, that finds fault. You know the one I'm talking about.

Don't push it away. We're going to meet it.

Notice... where do you feel this voice in your body? Is it in your chest? Your throat? Your gut? Just notice.

Good.

Now I want you to imagine you're standing at the edge of a forest. It's twilight - that liminal time between day and night. The forest ahead is deep and old, and somewhere in there... your Inner Critic lives.

You're going to walk into the forest now. Your guides are with you. You are safe.

As you walk deeper, the trees grow closer together. The light dims. And there, in a clearing ahead... you see a figure.

This is your Inner Critic.

Notice... what form does it take? Is it human? Animal? Shadow? Just let it reveal itself to you.

[PAUSE - 10 seconds]

Good.

Now, here's what most people don't know about the Inner Critic: it's not your enemy. It's a protector that got stuck in an old strategy.

Carl Jung taught us that everything we reject - everything we call "shadow" - is actually disowned power. The Critic is trying to protect you from something. It learned, probably when you were very young, that if it could criticize you FIRST... maybe you wouldn't get hurt by someone else's criticism.

So let's find out what it's protecting you from.

I want you to approach this figure now. Look into its eyes - or where its eyes would be - and ask:

"What are you protecting me from?"

And then listen. Let it answer. It might speak in words, images, feelings, or memories. Just receive whatever comes.

[PAUSE - 15 seconds]

What did it say?

[In live session, client would respond. In recorded journey, continue:]

Notice how old this protection strategy is. How long has this Critic been working this hard to keep you safe?

Place your hand on your heart and say to this part of yourself:

"Thank you for trying to protect me. I see how hard you've been working."

[PAUSE - 5 seconds]

And now, let's see if it's ready to transform.

I want you to invite your Wise Self into the clearing - the part of you that's connected to aether, to spirit, to the larger knowing. This is the you that's already whole.

Let your Wise Self approach the Critic. And watch what happens.

[PAUSE - 10 seconds]

Sometimes the Critic just needed to be seen. To be thanked. To know it could rest.

Ask it now: "If you didn't have to criticize anymore... what would you RATHER do? What gift do you actually want to give me?"

And listen.

[PAUSE - 15 seconds]

This is the transformation. The Critic becomes... the Mentor. The Discerner. The one who helps you see clearly - not to tear you down, but to help you grow.

Notice what it looks like now. Has its form changed? Its energy?

This is your Inner Mentor. Your ally.

Ask it: "What do you want me to know right now?"

[PAUSE - 10 seconds]

Receive this gift. This is shadow gold - the power that was locked in the Critic is now available to you as wisdom, discernment, clarity.

Thank your Inner Mentor. And ask it: "How can I work with you going forward?"

Listen.

[PAUSE - 10 seconds]

Good.

### INTEGRATION & RETURN (4-5 minutes)

Now it's time to return from the forest.

Your Inner Mentor walks with you now. Back through the trees, back toward the light. You can call on this ally anytime you need clarity or wise discernment.

You're back at the edge of the forest. Turn and face the direction you came from... and bow to the work you just did. This is sacred work.

Now, bring your awareness back to the circle of light around you. Your guides are still here, witnessing.

Place your hand on your heart again. Feel your fire center glowing. This is the creative fire you just reclaimed - the energy that was locked in self-criticism is now yours to CREATE with.

Breathe into your belly. Your water center. Let any remaining grief or old pain flow... it's okay. Water cleanses.

Breathe into your root. You are grounded. You are here. You are held by the earth.

When you're ready, wiggle your fingers and toes. Feel your body in the chair or on the floor beneath you.

And when it feels right... open your eyes.

Welcome back.

## POST-JOURNEY INTEGRATION

### Reflection Questions:
1. What form did your Inner Critic take?
2. What was it protecting you from?
3. What did it transform into (your Inner Mentor)?
4. What gift or teaching did you receive?

### Your Practice This Week:

Every morning, before you start your day, check in with your Inner Mentor.

Place your hand on your heart and ask: "What do I need to see clearly today?"

Listen for the response. It might come as words, images, or just a knowing.

This is how you build relationship with this ally. The more you acknowledge it, the stronger the alliance becomes.

And notice - when that old critical voice starts up - you can now ask: "Are you trying to protect me? What do you want me to see?"

The voice will shift. I promise.
