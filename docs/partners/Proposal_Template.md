## Questions & Concerns

Here are common questions we hear:

### "This is more than I budgeted. Can we phase it?"
Absolutely. We can launch with Phase 1 MVP (essential features only) and add Phase 2 features post-launch as revenue grows. Let's talk through what's essential vs. nice-to-have.

### "How involved do I need to be?"
**Heavy involvement (Weeks 1-4):** Brand workshop, design feedback, content creation
**Medium involvement (Weeks 5-10):** Weekly check-ins, feature testing
**Light involvement (Weeks 11-12):** Final review, launch prep

Total estimated time commitment: 20-30 hours over 12 weeks.

### "What if I need changes after launch?"
Included in monthly maintenance: [X] product updates, minor edits, content tweaks. Larger features discussed as Phase 2 scope.

### "Do I own the code?"
Yes. Full source code ownership transfers to you at launch. We retain right to use learnings for other partners (no proprietary business logic shared).

### "What happens if we need to pause or cancel?"
Life happens. If you need to pause, we can pick up where we left off within 6 months. If you need to cancel, payments are non-refundable but you keep all work completed to that point.

### "Why not use Shopify/WordPress/Squarespace?"
Those are great tools, but limited by templates and plugins. Custom development means:
- Exact features you need (no bloat)
- Conversational AI (not possible on platforms)
- Full design control (not template-bound)
- Performance optimized (not plugin-heavy)
- Your data, your rules

### "Can you guarantee results?"
We guarantee technical excellence and dedicated partnership. We cannot guarantee sales results—those depend on your product-market fit, marketing, and factors outside our control. But we'll do everything we can to set you up for success.
