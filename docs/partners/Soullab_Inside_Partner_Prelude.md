# **Soullab Inside Partner Prelude**

### *for Loralee Crowder — Astrology as Soul Curriculum*

*Soullab Foundation | October 2025*

Before we meet, this short reflection will help us attune to your vision and rhythm.
We build digital spaces that listen — and this is where that listening begins.

---

## 🜂 **Fire — The If**

**What is calling to be built now?**
What signal or impulse tells you *it's time* for this work to take digital form?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**When you imagine it alive and working beautifully, what does it change — in you, in others, in the world?**

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**If your digital field had a pulse or temperature, what would it feel like?**
(Warm like hearth? Bright like sunrise? Quiet like embers?)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## 🜄 **Water — The Why**

**Why does this need to exist?**
Not in the market sense — in the soul sense. What longing or ache does it tend?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**What part of your current practice feels ready to flow further?**
Is it teaching, transmission, community, lineage, or something subtler?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**Who do you imagine entering this space — and how do you want them to feel when they do?**

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## 🜃 **Earth — The How**

**What does "grounded technology" mean to you?**
What needs to be held, protected, made reliable?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**Which functions must this space perform?**
(Examples: astrology readings, courses, one-on-one sessions, archives, journal prompts, ritual tools, etc.)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**How do you envision sustaining it — time, energy, and resources?**
Would you like to keep it intimate, or let it grow over time?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## 🜁 **Air — The What**

**If your work could speak in its own voice online, what would it say?**

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**What kind of conversation do you want your visitors to have with it?**
Do they learn, reflect, play, explore, or be still?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**What form could that take?**
(Interactive astrology maps, guided reflections, dynamic journal prompts, etc.)

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

---

## 🜀 **Aether — The Is**

**When you imagine this project complete and breathing on its own — what *is* it?**
A school? A sanctuary? A map? A companion?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**What presence do you want it to carry when you're not there?**
If it spoke one line to a visitor, what would it whisper?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**How will you know it's alive?**
What subtle signs — in the way people respond or the way you feel — will tell you it's working?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

---

## 🌙 **Closing Reflection**

Take a few moments to imagine this line written across the top of your new site:

> *"The cosmos remembers you."*

What would follow beneath it?
Write whatever comes.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### **What Happens Next**

During our session, we'll move through what you share here — listening for pattern, tone, and rhythm.

Together, we'll sketch your field: not just a website, but a living space for your wisdom to move through.

---

### **How to Send It**

Email your reflections to **partnerships@soullab.life**
—or bring them as notes to our meeting.

They don't have to be polished.
**Honest fragments are enough.**
