## TIPS FOR SETTING UP FORM

1. **Use page breaks** between sections to avoid overwhelming
2. **Enable progress bar** so Kristen can see how far along she is
3. **Mark only truly essential questions as "required"**
4. **Use help text generously** to clarify what you're asking
5. **Enable "Edit after submit"** in case she wants to update answers
6. **Test the form yourself** before sending to catch any issues

---

**Time to create:** ~60-90 minutes to set up all 106 questions properly

**Alternative:** I can also create a TypeForm version which has a more conversational, one-question-at-a-time flow if you prefer that experience!
