# EMAIL DRAFT - Send to Kristen Nezat

**SUBJECT:** Soullab Inside - Your Apothecary App Discovery Questionnaire

---

Hi Kristen,

We're so excited to begin exploring what a custom PWA/field app could look like for your apothecary!

To ensure we create something that truly serves your vision and business needs, we've prepared a comprehensive discovery questionnaire. This helps us understand everything from your product catalog and customer journey to your technical requirements and growth goals.

**What's Included:**
- 10 sections covering business strategy, features, design, and operations
- ~100 questions (don't worry - many are checkboxes and quick answers!)
- Estimated time: 45-90 minutes (you can save and return to it)

**Two Ways to Complete This:**

**Option A - Fill Out Written Responses**
Download the attached questionnaire and fill it out at your own pace, then return it to kelly@soullab.org when complete.

**Option B - Schedule a Discovery Call**
We can walk through this together in a 60-90 minute video call where I ask questions conversationally and take notes. Often this feels easier than writing everything out!

Let me know which approach feels better for you, or if you'd like a hybrid (review the doc first, then discuss together).

**Next Steps After You Submit:**
1. We'll review your responses and create a detailed proposal
2. This will include feature scope, timeline, budget breakdown, and initial design concepts
3. We'll schedule a follow-up to present and refine together

**Questions?**
Reply to this email or text/call [your phone number] anytime.

Looking forward to bringing your apothecary into the Soullab Inside ecosystem!

Warmly,
Kelly
