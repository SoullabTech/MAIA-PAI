# Proposal Customization Guide
## How to Transform the Template into a Personal, Winning Proposal

**Time Required:** 2-3 hours per proposal
**Success Rate:** Well-customized proposals convert at 40-60% vs. 10-20% for generic ones

---

## The Golden Rule

**Every client should feel like this proposal was written specifically for THEM, not adapted from a template.**

Signs of good customization:
✅ Their exact words appear in the proposal
✅ Specific details from their questionnaire are referenced
✅ Features are prioritized based on THEIR goals
✅ Pricing matches their budget range
✅ Timeline aligns with their launch date

Signs of poor customization:
❌ Generic language ("your business", "your customers")
❌ Features they didn't ask for
❌ Budget way outside their range
❌ Copy-paste feel

---

## Step-by-Step Customization Process

### STEP 1: Review Their Intake Data (30 minutes)

**Open Three Tabs:**
1. Their Google Form responses (or MAIA conversation transcript)
2. Blank proposal template
3. Their website/social media

**Read Through Everything:**
- Highlight key phrases they used
- Note their excitement points (what lit them up?)
- Identify their pain points (what's not working?)
- Understand their "why" (deeper motivation)

**Create a Cheat Sheet:**
```
CLIENT: Kristen Nezat
BUSINESS: In Home Sanctuary
WHAT THEY DO: Apothecary - bath balms, candles, healing balms, aromatherapy

TOP GOALS (in their words):
1. "Make shopping feel like a healing ritual, not a transaction"
2. "Help customers find the RIGHT medicine for their needs"
3. "Build recurring relationships through subscriptions"

PAIN POINTS:
- Current Shopify feels sterile and impersonal
- Customers overwhelmed by choices
- Can't afford to do 1:1 consultations for everyone

MAGIC WAND VISION:
"I want customers to feel like they're sitting in my apothecary, telling me what's going on, and I'm pulling jars off the shelf for them. Like personalized medicine at scale."

BUDGET: $15-25k
TIMELINE: Launch by September (4 months)

SPECIAL NOTES:
- Loves the idea of AI guide ("This is exactly what I need!")
- Concerned about learning technical stuff
- Has beautiful product photos already
```

---

### STEP 2: Customize Executive Summary (15 minutes)

**BEFORE (Generic):**
> "After reviewing your questionnaire, we're excited to propose a partnership that brings your business into a living, conversational digital experience."

**AFTER (Customized):**
> "Kristen, after reading your questionnaire—especially your vision of customers feeling like they're 'sitting in your apothecary'—I'm excited to show you how we can create that experience at scale. Not a sterile online store, but a digital space where people are truly seen and guided to the medicine they need."

**Formula:**
1. Use their name
2. Quote something specific they said
3. Show you understand their deeper vision
4. Create anticipation for the solution

---

### STEP 3: Customize "What We Heard" Section (20 minutes)

**Pull Direct Quotes:**
- Use their exact language (put in quotes)
- Reference specific details they shared
- Show you were listening deeply

**EXAMPLE:**
```markdown
## What We Heard

You shared that:
- **Your primary goal:** "Make shopping feel like a healing ritual, not a transaction"
- **Your customers are:** "Women in their 30s-50s dealing with stress, anxiety, and grief who want natural alternatives"
- **Your biggest challenge:** "Shopify feels sterile. I can't guide people the way I do in person. They're overwhelmed."
- **Your dream experience:** "I want customers to feel like they're sitting in my apothecary, telling me what's going on, and I'm pulling jars off the shelf for them."

You also mentioned being excited about conversational AI ("This is exactly what I need!") but concerned about the technical learning curve. We've designed this proposal to address both.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Proves you read everything they wrote
- They see their own words reflected back
- Creates immediate trust and connection

---

### STEP 4: Prioritize Features Based on THEIR Goals (45 minutes)

**Don't Include Every Feature—Highlight What Matters to THEM**

**Decision Matrix:**

| Feature | Kristen's Priority | Include in MVP? |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Conversational AI (MAIA) | ⭐⭐⭐ (She said "exactly what I need!") | ✅ YES - Phase 1 |
| Subscriptions | ⭐⭐⭐ (Top 3 goal) | ✅ YES - Phase 1 |
| Personalized quiz | ⭐⭐ (Implies this with "guidance") | ✅ YES - Phase 1 |
| Community features | ⭐ (Didn't mention) | ❌ NO - Phase 3 or omit |
| Virtual consultations | ⭐ (Said can't afford 1:1) | ❌ NO - Suggest async via AI instead |
| Loyalty program | ⭐ (Didn't mention) | ⚠️ MAYBE - Phase 2 |

**Customize Feature Descriptions:**

**BEFORE (Generic):**
> "### Conversational AI Guide
>
> An AI-powered assistant that helps customers discover products."

**AFTER (Customized for Kristen):**
> "### MAIA as Your Digital Apothecary Guide
>
> Remember your vision of customers 'sitting in your apothecary, telling you what's going on'? That's exactly what MAIA creates.
>
> **How It Works:**
> ```
> MAIA: Welcome to In Home Sanctuary. I'm here to help you find
>       the right medicine for this season. What's alive in you today?
>
> CUSTOMER: I'm overwhelmed and can't sleep. My mind won't stop.
>
> MAIA: It sounds like your Air element is overstimulated—thoughts
>       swirling without anchor. Let me recommend grounding support:
>
>       🌙 Sacred Sleep Balm - Apply to heart, throat, wrists
>       🕯️ Deep Rest Candle - Light 30 minutes before bed
>       🛁 Earth Soak Bath - Pull you back into body
>
>       Would you like to add these to your cart, or shall we
>       explore other options?
> ```
>
> **Why This Matters for In Home Sanctuary:**
> - Your customers get personalized guidance 24/7 (the 1:1 attention you can't scale yourself)
> - MAIA speaks in YOUR voice (we train it on your language and approach)
> - Shopping becomes ritual discovery, not transaction
> - Higher cart values (holistic recommendations vs. single products)
> - Deeper customer relationships (they're having conversations, not clicking buttons)
>
> **Your Concern About Technical Learning:**
> You won't need to learn how MAIA works. You'll just have conversations with her during setup to teach her about your products and philosophy. We handle all the technical parts."

**Formula:**
1. Reference their specific vision
2. Show it in action (mockup/example)
3. Connect to THEIR goals
4. Address THEIR concerns

---

### STEP 5: Customize Timeline to Their Launch Date (15 minutes)

**If They Want to Launch in 4 Months (September):**

```markdown
## 16-Week Development Sprint
**Kickoff:** May 1
**Launch:** September 1 (Labor Day weekend—perfect timing for fall ritual season!)

### Weeks 1-2: Foundation (May 1-14)
- Kickoff call + brand workshop
- Your concern about technical stuff? We handle it. You focus on sharing your vision.

### Weeks 3-4: Design (May 15-28)
- We create 3 visual directions
- You pick the one that feels like YOU

### Weeks 5-8: Core Development (May 29 - Jun 25)
- Product catalog (your 47 products from the form)
- Conversational AI (MAIA learns your voice)
- Subscription setup

### Weeks 9-12: Advanced Features + Content (Jun 26 - Jul 23)
- Train MAIA on your product knowledge
- Upload photos (you mentioned you have beautiful ones!)
- Write ritual guides

### Weeks 13-16: Testing & Launch Prep (Jul 24 - Aug 27)
- Beta test with 10 of your current customers
- Final adjustments
- Train you on admin dashboard

### Sept 1: LAUNCH 🚀
Perfect timing for fall—when people are ready for grounding, sleep support, and cozy rituals.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Specific dates (not "Week 1-2")
- References their product count, photos, timing
- Shows thoughtfulness ("fall ritual season")

---

### STEP 6: Customize Pricing to Their Budget (30 minutes)

**Their Budget:** $15-25k
**Your Template Tiers:** Seed ($8-12k), Grow ($15-25k), Thrive ($30-50k)

**Recommendation Logic:**
- If budget is $15-25k → Recommend "Grow Partnership"
- But customize what's included based on their priorities

**BEFORE (Generic Grow Partnership):**
> **Investment:** $15,000 - $25,000
>
> **What's Included:**
> - Phase 1 + Phase 2 features
> - Custom design
> - Conversational AI
> - Subscription model

**AFTER (Customized for Kristen):**
> **Recommended: Grow Partnership (Customized for In Home Sanctuary)**
>
> **Investment:** $22,000
>
> **Why This Tier:**
> Based on your goals (conversational shopping, subscriptions, ritual focus) and your budget ($15-25k range), this gives you everything essential without overbuilding.
>
> **What's Included:**
>
> ✅ **Conversational AI (MAIA)**
> - Your #1 priority: "exactly what I need!"
> - Trained specifically on your 47 products
> - Speaks in your voice and philosophy
>

>
> ✅ **Beautiful Custom Design**
> - Uses your existing product photos (saves $$$)
> - Earthy, mystical aesthetic
> - Mobile-first (70% of apothecary shopping is mobile)
>
> ✅ **16-Week Timeline**
> - Launches September 1 (fall ritual season)
> - Weekly check-ins with Kelly
> - You're never left wondering what's happening
>
> ✅ **Training & Handoff**
> - You were concerned about technical learning
> - We provide 3 training sessions on the admin dashboard
> - Video tutorials you can reference anytime
> - 60 days of post-launch support
>
> **What's NOT Included (Can Add Later):**
> - Community features (you didn't mention this as a priority)
> - Virtual consultations (you said 1:1 isn't scalable)
> - Wholesale portal (not needed yet)
>
> These can be added as Phase 2 if your needs evolve.
>
> **Payment Structure:**
> - 50% deposit ($11,000) - due at contract signing
> - 25% milestone ($5,500) - due at Week 8 (when core features are built)
> - 25% final ($5,500) - due at launch (Sept 1)
>
> **Monthly Ongoing:**
> - Maintenance & support: $500/month
> - Includes: hosting, security updates, bug fixes, minor edits, monthly analytics review
>
> **Total Year 1 Cost:**
> - Development: $22,000
> - Maintenance (12 months): $6,000
> - Monthly tools (Stripe, email): ~$50-100/month
> - **Grand Total: ~$29,000**
>
> **ROI Projection:**
> If MAIA increases your average order value by just 20% (industry average is 40%), you'd need to sell ~$150k to break even. At your current volume of $X/month, that's Month X."
```

**Formula:**
1. Justify the tier choice (reference their budget)
2. Map every included feature to THEIR stated goals
3. Explain what's NOT included and why
4. Show payment timeline clearly
5. Calculate ROI in their terms

---

### STEP 7: Customize Success Metrics (20 minutes)

**Use THEIR Definition of Success**

**From Their Form:**
> Q: "What does success look like 6 months after launch?"
> A: "200 active subscribers, $20k/month in revenue, customers telling me they feel seen and supported."

**In Proposal:**
```markdown
## Your Definition of Success

From your questionnaire, you defined success as:
- 200 active subscribers
- $20k/month in revenue
- Customers feeling "seen and supported"

Let's work backwards to see if this is achievable:

**Subscriber Goal: 200**
- If you launch Sept 1 with 50 current subscribers...
- Need to add ~30 new subscribers/month
- With 3% conversion rate (conservative for personalized experience)
- You need ~1,000 visitors/month
- Your Instagram (X followers) + email list (X subscribers) + launch PR = achievable

**Revenue Goal: $20k/month**
- 200 subscribers × $65/month = $13k (subscription revenue)
- Need $7k in one-time purchases
- 100 orders × $70 AOV = $7k
- With conversational AI, we expect $90+ AOV (vs your current $X)
- **This is achievable**

**"Feeling Seen" Goal:**
- Harder to quantify, but we'll measure:
  - % of customers who chat with MAIA before purchasing (target: 60%+)
  - Average conversation length (deeper engagement = feeling heard)
  - Review sentiment analysis (do they mention feeling understood?)
  - Repeat purchase rate (feeling seen = loyalty)

**Our Commitment:**
If after 3 months you're not trending toward these goals, we'll hop on a call and adjust strategy—at no additional cost.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Shows you did math on THEIR specific goals
- References their current numbers
- Proves you're invested in their success (not just selling software)

---

### STEP 8: Add Personal Touches Throughout (30 minutes)

**Sprinkle These Throughout:**

1. **Reference Their Website/Social:**
   > "I loved the photo on your Instagram of the herb-drying rack in your studio. That aesthetic—rustic, intimate, medicinal—should be in every pixel of your app."

2. **Acknowledge Their Concerns:**
   > "You mentioned being worried about the learning curve. I want to address that head-on: you won't touch code. Ever. The admin dashboard is designed for humans, not developers."

3. **Share a Relevant Story:**
   > "When we built Loralee's astrology platform, she had a similar concern about AI 'not getting' the depth of her work. After training MAIA on her approach, clients now say it feels MORE personal than the static PDF reports she used to send."

4. **Honor Their Expertise:**
   > "You're the apothecary expert—we're the technology experts. Our job is to translate your medicine into code. You'll never feel like you're explaining your work to someone who doesn't get it."

5. **Add Specific Examples:**
   > "For your Sacred Sleep Balm (the one with lavender, chamomile, and vetiver), MAIA might ask: 'Is your sleeplessness from an overactive mind, or a restless body?' Then recommend the balm for mind-sleep, or the Earth Soak for body-sleep. That's the level of nuance we can build in."

## Time-Saving Tips

### Create Client-Specific Snippets

**Save these as reusable blocks:**

**For Apothecary/Wellness Clients:**
```
Your customers aren't just buying products—they're seeking healing, transformation, and support. A traditional e-commerce experience (browse catalog → add to cart → checkout) misses the sacred nature of that seeking.

Our approach: Every interaction is an opportunity for guidance, not just conversion.
```

**For Astrology/Mystical Clients:**
```
The digital world often feels sterile and mechanical—the opposite of the work you do. Our philosophy: technology can be soulful, intuitive, and aligned with your practice.

We're not building software. We're creating a digital vessel for your wisdom.
```

**For Busy Practitioners:**
```
I know you're already stretched thin serving clients, creating content, and running operations. Our commitment: this project should feel like support, not another thing on your plate.

We handle the heavy lifting. You focus on your medicine.
```

### Use Find-and-Replace for Basics

1. Write proposal with placeholders
2. Find-and-replace at the end:
   - `[CLIENT_NAME]` → Kristen
   - `[BUSINESS_NAME]` → In Home Sanctuary
   - `[PRIMARY_GOAL]` → Make shopping feel like a healing ritual
   - `[BUDGET]` → $22,000
   - `[LAUNCH_DATE]` → September 1

### Create a Proposal Tracker Sheet

| Client | Budget | Timeline | Top Priority | Concerns | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Kristen | $15-25k | Sept launch | Conversational AI | Technical learning | Pending |
| [Next] | | | | | |

## Red Flags (When to Adjust Proposal)

### Budget Mismatch
**Problem:** They want Thrive features ($30-50k) but have Seed budget ($8-12k)

**Solution:**
> "Based on your goals and budget, I want to be transparent: building everything you want for $10k isn't possible without compromising quality. Here are three paths forward:
>
> 1. **MVP Now, Grow Later** - Launch with core features for $12k, add advanced features as revenue grows
> 2. **Extend Timeline** - Spread payments over 12 months instead of 3 to make it cashflow-friendly
> 3. **Adjust Scope** - Prioritize your top 3 features, table the rest for Phase 2
>
> Which approach feels best for In Home Sanctuary?"

### Unrealistic Timeline
**Problem:** They want to launch in 6 weeks (you need 12-16)

**Solution:**
> "I want to honor your urgency AND build something that lasts. Rushing results in technical debt and a janky experience. Here's what I can do:
>
> - **Quick Win** - Launch a simple landing page + pre-orders in 2 weeks (capture demand now)
> - **Phased Launch** - Core features in 8 weeks (faster than normal), advanced features Month 3
> - **Be Honest** - If September 1 is critical for business reasons (seasonal sales), let's discuss if a simpler solution bridges you until we build the full version"

### Unclear Vision
**Problem:** Their questionnaire is vague or contradictory

**Solution:**
Don't send proposal yet. Instead:
> "Kristen, I want to make sure I'm proposing the right solution. A few things from your questionnaire weren't clear to me. Can we hop on a 30-minute call to clarify:
>
> - [Specific question 1]
> - [Specific question 2]
> - [Specific question 3]
>
> This will help me create a proposal that actually fits—not a generic pitch."

---

## After Sending the Proposal

### Follow-Up Email (1 Day Later)

```
Subject: Quick question about the proposal

Hi Kristen,

Did you get a chance to review the proposal I sent yesterday?

I'm curious—was there anything that particularly excited you? Or anything that raised questions?

No pressure to have read the whole thing (it's long!). Just wanted to make sure it landed in your inbox and see if you need anything clarified.

— Kelly
```

### Follow-Up Email (3 Days Later)

```
Subject: One thing I forgot to mention

Hi Kristen,

I was thinking more about your vision of customers feeling like they're "sitting in your apothecary"...

One thing I didn't emphasize enough in the proposal: we can add a voice mode to MAIA. Instead of typing, customers could literally TALK to her—like they're calling you for a consultation.

Just wanted to plant that seed. It's not in the initial scope, but it's a possibility for Phase 2 if voice feels aligned with how you work.

Anyway—let me know when you're ready to discuss the proposal. No rush.

— Kelly
```

### Proposal Review Call Script

**Agenda (60 min):**
1. (5 min) How are you feeling about it?
2. (25 min) Walk through proposal section by section
3. (20 min) Address questions and concerns
4. (10 min) Discuss next steps and timeline

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- "What excited you most?"
- "What gave you pause?"
- "Is the budget in range or do we need to adjust?"
- "Is the timeline realistic for you?"
- "Imagining this live in 4 months—what feels missing?"

**Objection Handling:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "It's more than I budgeted" | "I get it. Let's talk about what's essential vs. nice-to-have. Where can we trim?" |
| "I need to think about it" | "Absolutely. What specifically do you need to think through? Maybe I can help." |
| "I'm not sure about AI" | "Would it help to see a demo? I can show you MAIA in action with another client." |
| "My partner needs to approve" | "Of course. Would it help if I joined a call with both of you to answer questions?" |

---

## Final Tips

### Do's ✅
- Spend more time on customization than writing the template
- Use their words, not yours
- Show, don't tell (mockups, examples, walkthroughs)
- Be honest about what's realistic
- Follow up promptly and warmly

### Don'ts ❌
- Send generic proposals with minimal changes
- Over-promise features or timeline
- Use industry jargon they won't understand
- Make them feel small for their budget
- Ghost them if they go quiet

---

**Remember:** A great proposal doesn't just explain what you'll build—it shows that you understand their vision so deeply that they feel like you're already on their team.

When Kristen reads her proposal, she should think: "Kelly GETS it. She sees what I'm trying to create. I trust her to bring this to life."

That's when you win the project. ✨
