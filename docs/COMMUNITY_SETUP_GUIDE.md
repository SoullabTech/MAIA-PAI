## Moderation Guidelines

### Be Present But Not Overwhelming

**Good:**

- Share behind-the-scenes periodically

**Avoid:**
- Dominating conversation
- Corporate/salesy language
- Ignoring difficult questions
- Over-moderating (let conversation flow)

### Handle Feedback Gracefully

When someone critiques or shares frustration:
1. **Thank them** for the honesty
2. **Acknowledge** the experience
3. **Ask questions** to understand deeper
4. **Explain** what you can/can't do
5. **Follow up** when you address it

### Foster Peer Support

Encourage members to help each other:
- "Great question! Anyone in the community experienced this?"
- "Love seeing you all connecting"
- Highlight member contributions
