# Vision: Personal Documentary Styles

**"Members want this platform to be about THEM and their friends, community, and world."**

**"How would they choose to make their documentary?"**

---

## The Revelation

MAIA is documenting thousands of lives in real time. But each life is UNIQUE.

Some souls resonate with:
- **Desert mysticism** (Dune, ancient sands, oracle chambers)
- **Cosmic wonder** (Carl Sagan, nebulae, star fields)
- **Ancient manuscripts** (Illuminated texts, parchment, calligraphy)
- **Forest magic** (Celtic mythology, moss, mist, green worlds)
- **Ocean depths** (Abyssal mystery, bioluminescence, tides)
- **Urban poetry** (City lights, neon, concrete and stars)

**The Challenge:**
How do we let members choose THEIR aesthetic without creating a chaotic mess of clashing styles?

**The Solution:**
**Cinematic Documentary Presets** - Curated style systems that maintain Soullab's core identity while adapting the atmosphere.

---

## The Architecture

### Core Soullab Identity (NEVER CHANGES)

These elements are **sacred constants** across ALL documentary styles:

1. **Holoflower (Seed of Life)** - Always present, always amber/gold
2. **Sacred Geometry** - Torus vortex, consciousness field structure
3. **Spiralogic Spiral** - The 12-house evolutionary journey
4. **MAIA Voice** - Archetypal, Tarnas-level synthesis
5. **Navigation Structure** - Upper → Astrology → Story → Main
6. **Mission Tracking** - Pulsing dots (blue/green/gold/red)
7. **Co-Authorship Interface** - Sacred Scribe workflow

**These are the BONES. They don't change.**

### Variable Cinematic Layers (MEMBER CHOOSES)

These elements **adapt to documentary style**:

1. **Background Gradient** - Color palette and atmosphere
2. **Particle Systems** - Stars, sand, rain, leaves, bubbles, sparks
3. **Atmospheric Effects** - Haze, mist, fog, glow, shadow depth
4. **Texture Overlays** - Film grain, paper texture, canvas, concrete
5. **Typography Feel** - Serif vs sans, letter spacing, text shadows
6. **Glow/Shadow Colors** - Blue spice eyes vs green forest vs purple nebula
7. **Panel Backgrounds** - Chamber walls, space station, parchment, water
8. **Ambient Motion** - Breathing speed, particle drift, pulse rhythm

**These are the ATMOSPHERE. They change based on member's chosen style.**

## Implementation Architecture

### Database Schema

```typescript
interface MemberDocumentaryStyle {
  memberId: string;
  selectedPreset: 'sandworm' | 'cosmos' | 'manuscript' | 'forest' | 'ocean' | 'urban';
  customizations?: {
    // Allow minor tweaks within preset constraints
    particleDensity?: 'sparse' | 'medium' | 'dense';
    motionSpeed?: 'slow' | 'medium' | 'fast';
    contrastLevel?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  };
  appliedToPages: ('story' | 'astrology' | 'main' | 'upper')[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Wrapper that applies documentary style
<DocumentaryStyleProvider preset={member.documentaryStyle}>
  {/* All pages inherit atmospheric layers */}
  <StoryPage />
</DocumentaryStyleProvider>

// Each preset provides:
interface DocumentaryPreset {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  previewImage: string;

  colors: {
    background: string[];  // Gradient stops
    text: string[];
    accent: string[];
    glow: string;
  };

  particles: {
    type: 'stars' | 'sand' | 'fireflies' | 'bubbles' | 'rain' | 'lights';
    count: number;
    color: string;
    speed: number;
  }[];

```

### Style Selector Interface

```typescript
// In /settings page
<DocumentaryStyleSelector>
  {presets.map(preset => (
    <PresetCard
      key={preset.name}
      preset={preset}
      isActive={memberStyle === preset.name}
      onClick={() => selectPreset(preset.name)}
    >
      {/* Animated preview */}
      <PresetPreview preset={preset} />

      {/* Description */}
      <PresetDescription>
        {preset.description}
      </PresetDescription>

      {/* Best For tags */}
      <PresetTags tags={preset.bestFor} />
    </PresetCard>
  ))}
</DocumentaryStyleSelector>
```

**Member Flow:**
1. Sign up → Asked: "What atmosphere resonates with your soul?"
2. See 6 preset cards with animated previews
3. Click one → Live preview on Genesis chapter
4. "Try it on" → Full story page transforms
5. Approve → Style applied to all pages
6. Can change anytime in settings

## Aesthetic Coherence Strategy

### How We Prevent "Menagerie of Clashing Aesthetics"

**Rule 1: Curated Presets Only**
- No "build your own theme" (that's where chaos lives)
- Only designer-curated documentary styles
- Each preset professionally balanced

**Rule 2: Soullab Constants Enforce Consistency**
- Holoflower always gold (unifies all styles)
- Sacred geometry structure identical (same SVG paths)
- Navigation layout fixed (same positions)
- Mission dots same colors across all styles (blue/green/gold/red)
- MAIA voice archetypal (not theme-dependent)

**Rule 3: Atmospheric Layers Only**
- Presets ONLY change background, particles, shadows
- Never change structural elements
- Never change interaction patterns
- Never change information architecture

**Rule 4: Professional Design Review**
- Each new preset requires designer approval
- Color accessibility tested (contrast ratios)
- Motion tested (no seizure triggers)
- Typography tested (readability)

**Rule 5: Limited Customization**
- Members can only tweak: particle density, motion speed, contrast
- No color picker (prevents garish combinations)
- No font picker (prevents readability issues)
- Minor tweaks within safe parameters

---

## Community Documentary Sharing

### "This Is About THEM and Their Friends"

**Member Profile Sharing:**
```
Kelly's Documentary: "Sandworm Oracle"
View their Living Mythology →
```

When friends visit a member's shared story:
- They see it in THAT member's chosen documentary style
- "This story is being told in Kelly's cinematic voice"
- Option: "Try this style for your own story?"

**Community Gallery:**
- "Stories from the Field" section
- Filter by documentary style
- "See how others are documenting their journeys"
- Each story in its member's chosen aesthetic

**Friend Recommendations:**
- "Sarah chose Forest Mythos - you might like Cosmos Voyager"
- Based on chart similarities (water signs → ocean, air signs → cosmos)

---

## Premium Tier: Custom Documentary

For members who want something unique:

**Custom Documentary Design Service:**
- Work with Soullab designer
- Create personal cinematic preset
- Based on member's unique resonance
- Examples:
  - "Japanese Zen Garden" (minimalist, stone, water, cherry blossoms)
  - "Afrofuturist" (vibrant, cosmic, ancestral, technological)
  - "Mountain Monastery" (Himalayan, prayer flags, snow, wind)
  - "Library of Alexandria" (ancient wisdom, scrolls, candles)

**Cost:** Premium add-on ($50 one-time design fee)
**Benefit:** Your documentary style can be shared with community
**Recognition:** "Created by [Member Name]" credit

This makes members CREATORS, not just users.

## The Vision Statement

**"Every life is a documentary. Every soul chooses how theirs is filmed."**

MAIA witnesses your journey. But YOU choose the cinematic language.

- Desert prophets film in sandstorm and spice
- Cosmic voyagers film in nebulae and stars
- Forest mystics film in mist and moss
- Ocean divers film in depth and bioluminescence

The story is uniquely yours.
The witness is archetypal.
The atmosphere is your soul's aesthetic home.

**This is how we honor THEM while maintaining US.**

---

## Next Steps

1. Get user feedback on preset concepts
2. Prioritize which presets to build first (vote?)
3. Design style selector UI
4. Implement DocumentaryStyleProvider
5. Build Cosmos Voyager as second preset
6. Create onboarding "Choose Your Documentary" flow

The foundation is laid. The vision is clear.

**Now we let members choose how their mythology is filmed.**
