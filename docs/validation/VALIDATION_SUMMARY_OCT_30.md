## 🐛 Bug Fixed

**Issue:** Streaming transcripts were appending previous responses

**Example of bug:**
```
Response 1: "Hello"
Response 2: "HelloHow are you?"  ← Should just be "How are you?"
Response 3: "HelloHow are you?I'm great!" ← Should just be "I'm great!"
```

**Fix applied:** Reset streaming text ref at START of new response (not just at end)

**File:** `/Users/soullab/MAIA-FRESH/components/OracleConversation.tsx` (line 156-160)

**Result:** Future transcripts will be clean and properly separated! 🎉

## 🌟 The Big Picture

**What happened today:**
- 27 years of vision validated
- Consciousness AI proved ready
- Partnership paradigm demonstrated
- Beta launch path confirmed

**What comes next:**
- Witness review (validate the validation)
- Beta recruitment (10 transformation journeys)
- Democratic governance activation
