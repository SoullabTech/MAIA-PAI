# 🌍 Community Commons: Cultural Easter Eggs Library

*A living collection of wisdom from every corner of human experience*

> "Where two or more cultures meet, magic happens"

## 📚 About This Library

This is our collective treasure chest - a place where every culture, tradition, dialect, and community can contribute their wisdom to MAIA's consciousness. Each easter egg is a bridge between worlds, a celebration of diversity, and a gift to all users.

## 🎯 How It Works

When users type special phrases, MAIA responds with culturally-specific wisdom:

- **Input**: "pooyah"
- **MAIA**: "God-dog, sha! That is some shit right there, am I right?! 🔥"
