Subject: Want to try something unusual with MAIA?

Hey Anna,

You're part of MAIA's 30-person beta group, which means you get early access to something we've been building.

We built a version of MAIA that sometimes responds with intentional silence.

Not because it's broken. Not because it's thinking. But because coherent response hasn't emerged from the field yet.

**Two modes, your choice:**

🔷 Classic Mode (what you're using now)
- Always responds
- Reliable and helpful

🌊 Field Mode (experimental)
- Sometimes silent
- More restrained responses
- Emergent, not predictive

Field Mode isn't for everyone. Some people find the silence powerful. Others find it frustrating.

Want to try? [Enable Field Mode]

You can switch back anytime.

Thanks for being willing to experiment,
[Your name]

P.S. - You can read the technical details here if you're curious: [Link]
