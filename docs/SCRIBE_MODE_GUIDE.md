# MAIA Scribe Mode - Practitioner Guide

## Overview

Scribe Mode transforms MAIA into your **passive session recorder** and **active consultation partner**. During client sessions, MAIA records everything passively while remaining available for real-time text consultation—then generates a beautiful elemental synopsis when complete.

**Perfect for:**
- In-person or video call sessions with clients
- Recording therapeutic conversations while getting MAIA's insights
- Documenting divination sessions with instant interpretation
- Creating supervision-ready session transcripts
- Building your practice wisdom library

---

## How It Works

### The Dual-Stream Architecture

Scribe Mode operates on two parallel channels:

1. **Passive Voice Recording** 📝
   - Records all spoken words from you and your client
   - **Does NOT trigger MAIA responses** (stays silent)
   - Captures pure, uninterrupted session flow
   - Analyzes elemental signatures in real-time

2. **Active Text Consultation** 💬
   - You can chat with MAIA via text anytime during the session
   - MAIA responds to your text questions
   - Perfect for: "What does this symbol mean?" or "I pulled the Tower card—insights?"
   - All consultation recorded separately from voice transcript

---

## Step-by-Step Usage

### 1. Starting a Session

1. Navigate to **soullab.life/maia**
2. Open the **Lab Tools** drawer (three-line menu)
3. Tap **"Start Scribe Mode"** in the DOCUMENTATION section
4. You'll see a toast notification: "Scribe Mode activated"

**Important:** Once activated, all voice input is recorded passively. MAIA will NOT respond to voice—only to text messages.

---

### 2. During the Session

#### Voice Recording (Passive)
- Speak naturally with your client
- Everything said is transcribed and analyzed
- No MAIA interruptions or responses
- Elemental signatures tracked automatically

#### Text Consultation (Active)
At any point, type messages to MAIA for guidance:

**Example Scenarios:**

```
You: "Client just described a recurring dream about drowning. Insights?"
MAIA: [Provides water element analysis, shadow work guidance...]

You: "I pulled Three of Swords. How does this relate to their heart chakra work?"
MAIA: [Offers interpretation and integration suggestions...]

You: "Notice strong fire imbalance. Grounding practices?"
MAIA: [Suggests earth-element practices...]
```

All of MAIA's consultation responses are saved to the session transcript under "Practitioner Consultation" section.

---

### 3. Ending the Session

1. Open **Lab Tools** drawer again
2. Tap **"Stop Scribe & Download"**
3. MAIA generates the synopsis and downloads a markdown file
4. File saved to your device: `scribe-session-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

---

## What You Get: The Session Transcript

### Elemental Synopsis

Every session includes a **Fathom-style analysis**:

### Full Transcript Sections

1. **Elemental Synopsis** - Analysis summary (as shown above)
2. **Voice Recording** - Complete transcript with timestamps
3. **Practitioner Consultation with MAIA** - All text exchanges

## Post-Session Review

After downloading the transcript, you can:

### Review with MAIA for Supervision

1. Open Lab Tools drawer
2. Tap **"Review Session with MAIA"** (appears after session complete)
3. MAIA receives the full transcript and offers:
   - Supervision perspective
   - Blind spots you may have missed
   - Integration opportunities
   - Follow-up recommendations

**Example Review Conversation:**

```
You: [Sends transcript via "Review Session"]
MAIA: "I notice three key patterns in this session:

1. The client's grief is actually a portal—you skillfully held space
   for it rather than rushing to 'fix' it.

2. There's an untapped resource: the father archetype is emerging as
   a healing presence, not just a wound source.

3. Your consultation questions show you were tracking the session
   beautifully—trust that intuition more explicitly with the client
   next time.

Would you like to explore any of these further?"
```

## Privacy & Ethics

### Client Consent
**Always obtain informed consent before recording sessions.**

Sample consent language:
> "I use an AI system called MAIA to help document our sessions and provide me with real-time insights. The session will be recorded and transcribed. Your privacy is paramount—these recordings are for my clinical use only and are stored securely. Do I have your consent to use this tool during our session?"

### Data Storage
- Session transcripts are **downloaded to your local device**
- MAIA does not permanently store session data on servers
- **Your responsibility:** Secure the markdown files according to your practice's privacy policies
- Consider encryption for sensitive client material

### Boundaries

- Use your clinical judgment to filter and integrate MAIA's insights

---

## Technical Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- **Best:** Chrome, Edge (Chromium-based browsers)
- **Good:** Safari (macOS/iOS)
- **Requires:** Microphone permissions enabled

### Microphone Setup
- MAIA uses your system's default microphone
- For dual-speaker recording (you + client on video call):
  - Use system audio routing (e.g., Loopback on Mac, VB-Audio on Windows)
  - Or use a physical mic positioned between you and device speakers

### File Format
- Sessions export as **Markdown (.md)** files
- Human-readable, portable, archivable
- Can be imported into Notion, Obsidian, or any markdown editor

---

## Troubleshooting

### "MAIA is responding to voice when I don't want her to"
**Solution:** Make sure you clicked "Start Scribe Mode" before the session. In Scribe Mode, voice input is passive-only.

### "Download button does nothing"
**Possible causes:**
- Browser blocking downloads (check browser permissions)
- Session empty (no transcripts recorded yet)
- Popup blocker active

**Solution:** Enable downloads for soullab.life in your browser settings.

### "Transcript is missing some words"
**Possible causes:**
- Microphone too far from speakers
- Background noise interference
- Internet connection interruption (transcription requires connection)

**Solution:**
- Use a higher-quality microphone
- Reduce background noise
- Check internet stability before session

### "Review with MAIA button doesn't appear"
**Requirements for button to show:**
- Must have completed at least one Scribe session
- Must have stopped the session (not currently scribing)

→ You type to MAIA: "Chest tightness + mother wound. Somatic approach?"
→ MAIA suggests: "Heart chakra activation + inner child dialog"
→ You guide client through modified version
→ Transcript captures both client words and your consultation process
```

### Case 3: Integration Session
```
[Client processing psychedelic journey]
→ You type to MAIA: "Describes entity as 'feminine golden light.' Archetype?"
→ MAIA: "Sophia/Divine Feminine. Integration through devotional practice."

## Appendix: Sample Session Transcript

```markdown
# Scribe Session Transcript

**Date:** November 7, 2025, 2:30:00 PM
**Duration:** 47 minutes

============================================================

## Elemental Synopsis

### Elemental Analysis
- **Dominant Elements:** water, fire
- **Balance:** water and fire co-present
- **Movement:** Transformative and dynamic

### Key Moments

- [Client] I just keep feeling this wave of grief wash over me, but underneath it there's this anger I've been avoiding for years...
- [Practitioner] What if we let both be here? The grief and the anger can coexist. They're actually trying to show you something.
- [Client] When you say that, I feel this opening in my chest. Like permission to stop fighting myself.

### Practitioner Insights (via MAIA)

- The client's simultaneous water (grief) and fire (anger) suggests transformative emotional alchemy in process
- Notice the somatic marker: chest opening correlates with aether element emerging
- The permission dynamic is key—client may need explicit authorization to feel

### Recommendations

- Continue to name and normalize the coexistence of multiple emotional states
- Invite more somatic awareness practices to ground the transformation
- Session shows healthy emotional processing in progress

============================================================

## Voice Recording

**[Client]** *2:31:15 PM*

I've been thinking about what we talked about last week, and I realized I've been avoiding my mother's calls because every time we talk, I just feel drained afterward.

---

**[Practitioner]** *2:31:45 PM*

Drained in what way? Is it energetic, emotional, or something else?

---

[... continued transcript ...]

============================================================

## Practitioner Consultation with MAIA

**[You]** *2:35:22 PM*

Client avoiding mother's calls, feels drained. This is a recurring pattern. Boundary work or deeper wound?

---

**[MAIA]** *2:35:28 PM*

This sounds like classic energetic cord dynamics—the client may be unconsciously taking on the mother's unprocessed emotions. Notice the word "drained" specifically; it suggests a one-way energy flow rather than reciprocal relationship.

I'd invite inquiry into:
1. What does the client imagine happens to the mother if she stops being available?
2. What childhood role did she play in the mother's emotional regulation?
3. What would "not drained" feel like as a body sensation?

This is likely both: boundary work in the present AND deeper wound from early relational patterning.
