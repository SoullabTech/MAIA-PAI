## OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### TIER 1 & 2: RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS & ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS

**Subject:** Research Collaboration Proposal: Constitutional AI for Transformation Work

Dear [Name/Team],

I'm reaching out to explore potential research collaboration on a project at the intersection of AI safety, human development, and transformation.

**Background:**

I'm Kelly Nezat, [your credentials]. I've built MAIA/KAIROS - a Constitutional AI system specifically designed to support human transformation while preventing dependency, misalignment, and harm.

**What makes this novel:**
- Constitutional AI principles (40+ constraints embedded)
- Graduation Protocol (AI designed to make itself unnecessary)
- Democratic governance (User Council with real power)
- Rigorous beta testing (Jan-Mar 2026, 10 participants)

**Why I'm reaching out:**

Your work on [specific relevant research] aligns with key questions we're exploring:
- Can AI support genuine autonomy rather than dependency?
- How do Constitutional principles hold under real-world use?
- What safety protocols prevent harm in transformation contexts?

**Collaboration opportunity:**

[Specific to each organization - examples:]
- For Anthropic: Share findings on Constitutional AI effectiveness
- For Stanford HAI: Faculty collaboration + publication partnership
- For Partnership on AI: Working group participation + case study

**What I'm offering:**
- Full transparency to beta test data (anonymized)
- Co-authorship on publications (if partnership forms)
- Unique case study in applied AI alignment

**What I'm seeking:**
- Your expertise and feedback
- Potential research partnership or affiliation
- Access to your network (if appropriate)

**Next step:**

Would you be open to a 30-minute exploratory call to discuss potential collaboration?

I've attached:
- One-page research overview
- Constitutional framework summary
- Beta test protocol

Thank you for considering this.

Best,
Kelly Nezat

### TIER 3 & 4: PRACTITIONERS & WISDOM COMMUNITIES

**Subject:** Seeking [Clinical/Wisdom] Perspective on Transformation AI

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out because your work on [specific area] is exactly the wisdom I need right now.

**Context:**

I've built an AI system called MAIA/KAIROS designed to support transformation work - shadow integration, embodied practice, developmental growth. But I'm concerned about [specific to them: clinical safety / honoring contemplative wisdom / preventing dependency].

**I need your perspective before going further.**

**What I've built:**
- Constitutional AI with embedded safety constraints
- Emphasis on embodied practice (not just AI dialogue)
- Designed to support (not replace) [therapy/spiritual practice/human relationships]
- 3-month beta test launching January 2026

**What I'm asking:**

Would you be willing to offer [clinical consultation / wisdom holder perspective] (30-60 min call, $200-500 compensation)?

Specific questions I'd value your input on:
- [Customize based on their expertise]
- What are the highest risks you see?
- What would make this safer/more aligned?

**What you'd receive:**
- Compensation for your time
- Acknowledgment as advisor (if you wish)
- Lifetime access to MAIA (if interested)
- Opportunity to shape emerging transformation AI

**Timing:** I'm launching publicly in November and beta testing in January. Your wisdom now shapes what we build.

Would you be open to a conversation?

If not, I completely understand. And if you know someone else whose perspective would be valuable, I'd be grateful for the connection.

Thank you,

Kelly Nezat

---

## CONTINGENCY: IF NO PARTNERSHIPS MATERIALIZE

**Proceed independently with rigor:**

1. **Self-fund beta test** (keep quality high even without institutional support)
2. **Publish openly** (blog posts, open-access papers, transparent data)
3. **Build credibility through results** (let outcomes speak)
4. **Continue outreach** (partnerships take time - don't give up after first wave)
5. **Leverage community** (FORGE members, podcast listeners, beta participants become network)

**Remember:** Many groundbreaking projects start outside institutions and earn credibility through demonstrated impact.

---

## CLOSING THOUGHTS

**Research partnerships are accelerants, not requirements.**

MAIA/KAIROS is valuable whether Stanford says so or not.

But partnerships:
- Make the work stronger (external review catches blind spots)
- Make the work reach further (access to networks and platforms)
- Make the work more credible (institutional validation matters in research)

**Approach with humility, clarity, and generosity:**
- Humility: "We're pioneering something new and need your wisdom"
- Clarity: "Here's exactly what we're doing and why it matters"
- Generosity: "We'll share all our learnings and credit your contributions"

**The right partnerships will emerge when the work is ready and the timing is right.**
