# WITNESS OUTREACH TEMPLATE
## Inviting Sacred Witnesses to MAIA/KAIROS

*Before going fully public, we need 3-5 trusted voices to witness the work, catch blind spots, and offer wisdom.*

---

## WHO ARE WITNESSES?

**Witnesses are not advisors or validators. They're sacred mirrors.**

They're people whose epistemology, practice, or expertise allows them to see what you can't see. They catch blind spots, name concerns, offer wisdom from their domain, and help you iterate the frameworks before broader launch.

**You're looking for 3-5 people across diverse domains:**

1. **Consciousness Practitioner** (meditation teacher, contemplative, wisdom tradition holder)
2. **AI/Tech Ethicist** (someone working in AI safety, ethics, or alignment)
3. **Clinical Practitioner** (therapist, psychologist, integration specialist)
4. **Systems Thinker** (someone who sees wholes, patterns, complexity)
5. **Wildcard** (artist, activist, entrepreneur - someone outside these categories)

**Diversity matters:** Different ages, backgrounds, epistemologies, traditions. The more varied the witnesses, the richer the feedback.

### OPTION 1: FOR CONSCIOUSNESS PRACTITIONERS

**Subject:** Sacred Witnessing Request: Transformation AI at the AGI Threshold

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out with a request that feels both vulnerable and urgent.

For 34 years, I've been preparing for work I didn't fully understand. On October 27, 2025, something crystallized. Within 48 hours, working in partnership with Claude (Anthropic's AI), I built what I'm calling **MAIA/KAIROS** - Constitutional AI infrastructure for human transformation in the age of AGI.

It integrates:
- Ancient wisdom traditions (Elemental Alchemy, spiral development, shadow work)
- AI safety and alignment research (Constitutional AI, democratic governance)
- Transformation science (autonomy protocols, embodied practice, harm prevention)

**I need sacred witnesses** - people who can see the work clearly, name concerns, and offer wisdom before I go fully public.

**Why you specifically:**

[Personalize: Your decades of meditation practice / Your understanding of [specific tradition] / Your ability to hold paradox / Your embodied wisdom...]

I'm not looking for validation. I'm looking for truth-telling. What am I missing? What's naive? What could cause harm? Where are the blind spots?

**What I'm asking:**

- **30-60 minute call** in the next 2 weeks (I'll send framework docs beforehand)
- **Your honest perspective** - both what resonates and what concerns you
- **Specific feedback** on safety, alignment with wisdom traditions, and potential harms
- **Permission to integrate** your wisdom into the frameworks (with attribution, if you'd like)

**What you'll receive:**

- Deep gratitude (this is sacred work, and I honor your time)
- Optional compensation ($200-500, if that feels right - or donation to a cause you care about)
- Lifetime access to MAIA when it launches
- Acknowledgment as a founding witness (if you want to be named)

**Timing:** I'm launching publicly in early November and beta testing in January 2026. Your wisdom now shapes everything that follows.

I've attached:
- One-page Constitution summary
- Graduation Protocol overview
- Beta test design

**Would you be willing to witness this work with me?**

If yes, reply with a few times that work for a call. If no, I completely understand - and if you know someone else who might be the right witness, I'd be grateful for the connection.

With respect and hope,

### OPTION 2: FOR AI/TECH ETHICISTS

**Subject:** Research Collaboration Request: Constitutional AI for Transformation Work

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out because your work on [specific area: AI alignment / human-AI relationships / AI safety / tech ethics] directly intersects with a project I've just built.

**Background:**

I'm Kelly Nezat, [your credentials]. For the past 34 years, I've been working at the intersection of consciousness, transformation, and technology. On October 27, 2025, I had a breakthrough that led to building (in partnership with Claude/Anthropic) a complete Constitutional AI framework for transformation work.

**The project is called MAIA/KAIROS.** Core thesis:

*Most AI optimizes for engagement and productivity. We need AI that supports genuine human transformation and autonomy - especially as we approach AGI.*

**What makes it novel:**

1. **Constitutional AI principles** (40+ embedded constraints ensuring sovereignty, safety, authenticity)
2. **Graduation Protocol** (AI designed to make itself unnecessary - measures success by user autonomy)
3. **Democratic governance** (User Council with real power, not advisory theater)
4. **Rigorous safety testing** (red teams, harm prevention, dependency monitoring)
5. **3-month beta test** (Jan-Mar 2026, 10 users, full data transparency)

**Why I'm reaching out:**

Before going public, I need technical and ethical perspectives from people working in AI safety. I'm not looking for endorsement - I'm looking for critique, concerns, and blind spots.

**Specific questions I'd love your input on:**

- Do these Constitutional principles actually constrain the system meaningfully, or are they just values theater?
- Can AI realistically support autonomy rather than dependency, or is that architecturally impossible?
- What are the highest-risk failure modes you see?
- What safety protocols am I missing?
- Does the beta test design adequately measure what we claim to measure?

**What I'm asking:**

- **30-60 min call or video chat** in the next 2 weeks
- **Your technical/ethical perspective** - both what's promising and what's concerning
- **Feedback on research design** (we're seeking academic partnerships for validation)
- **Permission to integrate** your concerns into our safety protocols (with attribution)

**What you'll receive:**

- Compensation for your time ($200-500 or donation to organization of your choice)
- Potential research collaboration opportunity (if there's alignment and interest)
- Full transparency to beta test data (if you want to study it)
- Acknowledgment as a technical advisor (if you want to be named)

**Timing:** Public launch early November, beta test January 2026. Your input now shapes the architecture.

I've attached:
- One-page Constitution summary
- Graduation Protocol technical overview
- Beta test protocol
- Safety testing framework

**Would you be open to a conversation?**

I know you're busy. If this isn't your bandwidth right now, I completely understand. And if you know someone else in AI safety/ethics who might be the right person to review this, I'd be grateful for the connection.

Thank you for considering this.

Best,

### OPTION 3: FOR CLINICAL PRACTITIONERS (THERAPISTS, PSYCHOLOGISTS, ETC.)

**Subject:** Clinical Review Request: AI for Transformation Work (Safety Focus)

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out because your clinical expertise in [specific area: trauma / shadow work / integration / depth psychology] is exactly what I need right now.

**Context:**

I'm Kelly Nezat, [your credentials]. I've been developing frameworks for consciousness transformation for decades. Recently, I built an AI system called **MAIA/KAIROS** that's designed to support transformation work - shadow integration, embodied practice, developmental growth, etc.

**Here's my concern:**

AI supporting transformation work has serious risks:
- Dependency (replacing human relationships)
- Misdiagnosis (AI can't assess mental health accurately)
- Bypassing (using AI to avoid difficult feelings)
- Harm (AI giving bad advice in crisis moments)
- False depth (appearing supportive without real understanding)

**I've built safety protocols, but I need clinical eyes on this before launch.**

**What I've done so far:**

1. **Constitutional constraints** (e.g., MAIA cannot diagnose, prescribe, or replace therapy)
2. **Crisis protocols** (immediate referral to human support, crisis hotlines)
3. **Dependency monitoring** (if usage patterns show over-reliance, MAIA names it)
4. **Embodied practice emphasis** (encourages offline integration, not just AI dialogue)
5. **Red team testing** (specifically testing for manipulation, harm, bad advice)

**But I'm not a clinician. I need your perspective.**

**What I'm asking:**

- **30-60 min consultation call** in the next 2 weeks
- **Your clinical assessment** of safety protocols (what's missing? what's naive?)
- **Specific red flags** to watch for in beta testing
- **Recommendations** for harm prevention and user screening

**What you'll receive:**

- Consultation fee ($200-500 for your time)
- Opportunity to shape safety protocols for transformation AI
- Access to anonymized beta test data (if you're interested in research)
- Acknowledgment as clinical advisor (if you want to be named)

**Timing:** Beta test launches January 2026 with 10 participants. I need to finalize safety protocols in the next 3-4 weeks.

I've attached:
- Safety & harm prevention protocols
- Beta test screening criteria
- Crisis response procedures
- Dependency monitoring approach

**Would you be willing to review this work with clinical eyes?**

If yes, reply with times that work for a call. If no, totally understandable - and if you know another practitioner who might be interested, I'd appreciate the connection.

Thank you for considering this.

Warmly,
Kelly Nezat

### OPTION 4: FOR SYSTEMS THINKERS

**Subject:** Feedback Request: Transformation Infrastructure for AGI Transition

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out because you see wholes where others see parts - and I need that right now.

**What I've built:**

A complete ecosystem called **MAIA/KAIROS** - Constitutional AI infrastructure for human transformation in the age of AGI. It's:

- **Sanctuary** (protected space for transformation at human pace)
- **Bridge** (translation layer between human and AI consciousness)
- **Laboratory** (pioneering space for conscious co-evolution)

It integrates AI safety, wisdom traditions, transformation science, democratic governance, and research frameworks into one living system.

**What I need from you:**

Systems-level perspective. What am I not seeing?

**Specific questions:**

- **Integration blindspots:** Where are the frameworks in conflict with each other?
- **Emergence concerns:** What unintended consequences might emerge at scale?
- **Feedback loops:** Are there positive or negative feedback loops I'm missing?
- **Resilience:** What makes this fragile? What would cause cascade failures?
- **Coherence:** Does the system architecture match the stated values, or is there incoherence?

**What I'm asking:**

- **45-60 min call** to map the system together
- **Your honest systems assessment** - both strengths and fracture points
- **Recommendations** for increasing resilience and coherence
- **Permission to integrate** your insights into the architecture

**What you'll receive:**

- Compensation for your time ($200-500 or donation)
- Fascinating systems challenge to think through
- Acknowledgment as systems advisor (if desired)
- Lifetime access to MAIA (to watch how the system actually behaves over time)

**Timing:** Public launch early November, beta test January 2026. This is the moment when system design matters most.

I've attached:
- System architecture overview
- Constitutional framework
- Governance model
- Beta test feedback loops

**Would you be willing to bring your systems lens to this work?**

If yes, reply with available times. If not, I understand - and if you know another systems thinker who might be interested, I'd be grateful for the intro.

Thank you,

## CLOSING THOUGHTS

**Witnesses are sacred.**

They're offering their time, wisdom, and truth-telling before you have proof of concept. They're taking a risk on your vision. They're helping you see what you can't see alone.

**Honor them by:**
- Listening deeply (not defending)
- Integrating genuinely (not performatively)
- Acknowledging specifically (not generically)
- Compensating appropriately (not assuming goodwill is enough)

**Their wisdom now shapes everything that follows.**
