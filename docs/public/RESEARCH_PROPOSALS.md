## PROPOSAL 1: ANTHROPIC - Constitutional AI Team

**TO:** Jared Kaplan / Sam Bowman / Anthropic Research Team
**FROM:** Kelly Nezat, Founder MAIA/KAIROS
**RE:** Research Collaboration - Constitutional AI for Transformation Work

---

### THE OPPORTUNITY

You pioneered Constitutional AI in research. We've operationalized it for real-world transformation work - and we'd like to collaborate on validating the approach.

### WHAT WE'VE BUILT

**MAIA/KAIROS** - A transformation AI system with:
- 40+ constitutional principles embedded in every agent
- Graduation protocols that prevent dependency
- Democratic governance (users co-create platform)
- Rigorous safety testing (8 threat categories, 5 testing phases)

**Built entirely on Claude** - your Constitutional AI approach extended into consciousness work.

### THE RESEARCH QUESTION

**"Does Constitutional AI maintain alignment in transformation contexts where users are emotionally vulnerable and AI has high influence potential?"**

This is a critical test case because:
- Users share intimate struggles, shadow material, trauma
- Long-term relationships create dependency risk
- Transformation claims are subjective and hard to validate
- Manipulation potential is high

**If Constitutional AI works here, it works anywhere.**

### WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

**3-Month Beta Test (January-March 2026):**
- 10 users, diverse backgrounds
- Full interaction data (anonymized, with consent)
- Weekly constitutional alignment audits
- Quantitative + qualitative measures

**We offer:**
- Access to all beta test data for research
- Co-authorship on publications
- Real-world stress-testing of constitutional principles
- Case study of alignment in high-stakes emotional contexts

**We need:**
- Anthropic research team feedback/collaboration
- Early access to Claude 4 / next-gen models for testing
- Support navigating AI safety landscape
- Introductions to regulatory/governance bodies

### TIMELINE

- **November 2025:** Share frameworks, get feedback
- **December 2025:** Refine based on input, recruit beta users
- **January-March 2026:** Run beta test, collect data
- **April 2026:** Analysis and publication

### DELIVERABLES

- Research paper (co-authored): "Constitutional AI for Transformation Work: A Real-World Test"

## PROPOSAL 2: STANFORD HAI - Human-Centered AI Institute

**TO:** Dr. James Landay / Dr. Fei-Fei Li / Stanford HAI Faculty
**FROM:** Kelly Nezat, Founder MAIA/KAIROS
**RE:** Research Collaboration - Human-AI Relationship Dynamics

---

### THE OPPORTUNITY

We're building transformation AI that actively encourages user autonomy rather than creating dependency. This is unprecedented, and we'd like Stanford HAI's partnership in validating and studying the approach.

### THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING

Most AI optimizes for engagement and retention. This creates:
- Learned helplessness (users can't function without AI)
- Psychological manipulation (dark patterns, FOMO)
- Erosion of human agency and discernment

**What if we designed the opposite?** AI that graduates users into autonomy.

### WHAT WE'VE BUILT

**MAIA/KAIROS** - Transformation AI with:
- **Graduation Protocol:** 4-phase pathway from dependency to autonomy
- **Constitutional AI:** 40+ principles preventing manipulation
- **Democratic Governance:** Users have real power over platform evolution

### THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. **Does the Graduation Protocol work?**
   Do users become MORE autonomous over time, or more dependent?

2. **What interaction patterns predict autonomy vs dependency?**
   Can we identify linguistic/behavioral markers early?

3. **How does constitutional AI affect user wellbeing?**
   Does embedding ethical principles improve outcomes?

4. **What's the optimal human-AI relationship design?**
   Teacher→Coach→Peer→Alumni - is this the right progression?

### WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

**Pilot Study (January-March 2026):**
- 10 users, 3-month longitudinal study
- Baseline → Mid-point → Endpoint assessments
- Autonomy, wellbeing, psychological flexibility measures
- Full interaction data (anonymized, IRB approved)

**Follow-up Studies:**
- RCT comparing constitutional vs non-constitutional AI
- Scale to 100+ users for robust dataset
- Phenomenological interviews on AI relationship quality

**We offer:**
- Novel dataset: transformation journeys at scale
- Access to all data for research and publication
- Co-authorship on papers
- Student thesis/dissertation opportunities
- Infrastructure for rapid prototyping and testing

**We need:**
- Stanford HAI faculty collaboration and methodological guidance
- IRB approval and ethical oversight
- Grant funding support (NSF, NIH applications)
- Academic credibility and peer review

### PUBLICATION TARGETS

- *Nature Human Behaviour:* "Designing AI for User Autonomy"
- *CHI (Human-Computer Interaction):* "Graduation Protocols in AI Systems"
- *Psychological Science:* "Constitutional AI and Wellbeing Outcomes"

### TIMELINE

- **Q1 2026:** Pilot study, initial findings
- **Q2 2026:** Grant applications, scale to 100 users
- **Q3-Q4 2026:** Data analysis, paper submissions

- **Phenomenological Understanding:** Trained on consciousness research, mystical experience, ego dissolution
- **Constitutional Safety:** Won't replace therapy, clear boundaries, crisis protocols
- **Graduation Design:** Supports autonomy, not dependency
- **Embodied Integration:** Emphasizes somatic practice, not just mental processing

### THE RESEARCH QUESTION

**"Can AI effectively support psychedelic integration, and how does it compare to human therapists and integration circles?"**

**Secondary questions:**
- What types of integration work benefit from AI vs require humans?
- How do we measure integration quality?
- What are the risks and how do we mitigate them?

### WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

**Pilot Study (6 months):**
- 20 participants post-psychedelic session (legal contexts only)
- 10 receive MAIA integration support
- 10 receive standard integration circles (control)
