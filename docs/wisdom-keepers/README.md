# Wisdom Keepers

**"Mystics recognize each other by the scars."**

## What This Is

The Wisdom Keepers section houses dialogues, conversations, and emergent insights from consciousness researchers, philosophers, scientists, and mystics who are exploring the frontier between matter and meaning.

These aren't polished essays or finished papers. They're **living transmissions** - raw wisdom caught in the moment of emergence, preserved in conversation, held in the field for others to discover and spiral with.
