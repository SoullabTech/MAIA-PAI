   - **Conjunctio** ⚡: Integration (bring opposites together, synthesize)
   - **Fermentation** 🍄: Creative emergence (chaos leads to innovation)
   - **Distillation** 💎: Refinement (clarity emerges, essence is distilled)
   - **Coagulation** 🏔️: Stabilization (manifest and ground new patterns)

3. **Apply Phase-Specific Practices**
   - Read the operation description and typical duration
   - Follow recommended practices for your current phase
   - Avoid major decisions during Calcination/Solutio phases
   - Time important changes during Coagulation phases

4. **Track Your Patterns**
