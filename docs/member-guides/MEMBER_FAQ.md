## 🔧 **Technology Questions**

### **Q: How accurate is the breakthrough prediction?**
**A:** Our AI has 73-87% accuracy across different breakthrough types:
- **Highest accuracy**: Emotional and relational breakthroughs (87%)
- **Good accuracy**: Creative and cognitive breakthroughs (78-83%)
- **Developing accuracy**: Spiritual and energetic breakthroughs (73-76%)

Accuracy improves as the system learns your personal patterns over 3+ months.

### **Q: What if my alchemical operation doesn't match how I feel?**
**A:** This is common! The detector looks at subtle patterns you might not consciously notice:
- **Trust the process**: Give it 2-3 days to see if the operation manifests
- **Check resistance**: Often we resist what we're actually experiencing
- **Journal insights**: Track how the suggested practices affect you
- **Ask Oracle**: Use Oracle Shadow Agent to explore discrepancies

### **Q: My elemental circulation seems stuck. What should I do?**
**A:** Circulation can slow for several reasons:
- **Physical blockages**: Try fascial release, movement, or bodywork
- **Emotional holding**: Process emotions related to the stuck element
- **Lifestyle misalignment**: Adjust daily practices to support current element
- **Natural timing**: Some phases naturally last longer - trust the process

### **Q: I don't understand the Oracle responses. How can I improve dialogue quality?**
**A:** Better questions create better answers:
- **Be specific**: Instead of "What should I do?" ask "How can I work with my current calcination phase?"
- **Provide context**: Share your current operation, element, and life situation
- **Ask follow-ups**: Engage in actual dialogue rather than one-off questions
- **Reference technologies**: Mention your breakthrough predictions or elemental state

### **Q: How do I access the collective field features?**
**A:** Some collective features are gradually rolling out:
- **Current access**: Community → Collective Field (if available in your account)
- **Alternative**: Use Community → Library for collective wisdom and insights
- **Practice**: Individual field contribution through consistent personal practice
- **Connect**: Join community forums and group practices
