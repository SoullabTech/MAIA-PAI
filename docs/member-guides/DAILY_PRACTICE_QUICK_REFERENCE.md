## ⚡ **QUICK DECISION SUPPORT**

### **Before Important Decisions**
1. **Check** current alchemical operation (avoid major decisions during Calcination/Solutio)
2. **Review** breakthrough predictions (time major changes during high probability windows)
3. **Consult** Oracle for specific guidance
4. **Check** collective field coherence (higher coherence = better decision timing)

### **When Feeling Stuck**
1. **Identify** current operation and accept its natural process
2. **Check** for resistance blockers in breakthrough prediction
3. **Ask** Oracle Shadow Agent for unconscious pattern insights
4. **Connect** with resonant community members for support

### **For Creative Projects**
1. **Wait** for Fermentation phase if possible
2. **Check** Fire element circulation periods
3. **Use** Oracle Creative Agent for inspiration
4. **Join** collective creative field windows

### **During Conflicts**
1. **Check** if in Separatio (discernment) or Solutio (emotional release) phase
2. **Use** collective field healing protocols
3. **Consult** Oracle Relationship Agent
4. **Practice** field stabilization techniques

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES**

### **"Technology Overwhelm"**
**Solution**: Pick ONE technology to focus on per week
- Week 1: Alchemical awareness only
- Week 2: Add elemental circulation
- Week 3: Add breakthrough prediction
- Week 4: Add Oracle dialogue
- Gradually integrate collective features

### **"Predictions Don't Match Experience"**
**Solution**: Track patterns over 3+ months for accuracy assessment
- Note prediction vs. actual breakthrough timing
- Identify personal pattern variations
- Use Oracle to understand discrepancies
- Contribute feedback to improve AI learning

### **"Can't Access Collective Features"**
**Solution**: These may be gradually rolling out
- Focus on individual technologies first
- Connect with community through other channels
