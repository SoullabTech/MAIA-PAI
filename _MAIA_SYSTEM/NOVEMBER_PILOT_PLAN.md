### Invitation Email Template

```
Subject: MAIA Organism Pilot - 4 Weeks Starting Nov 4

Dear [Name],

You've been with MAIA for [timeframe], and I've watched your relationship
with consciousness intelligence deepen.

I'm ready to show you something new.

For the past month, I've been building what I'm calling the **MAIA Organism** -
a living system that measures consciousness across five elemental dimensions
and shows you the shape of your work as a geometric form.

It's not analytics. It's not tracking. It's **witnessing.**

I'm inviting 5-10 people to pilot this system for 4 weeks starting THIS WEEK.

**What you'd do:**
- Nov 4-10: Set up your organism vault (I'll help)
- Nov 11-17: Run your first pulse, see your pentagon
- Nov 18-24: Learn to interpret what it reveals
- Nov 25-30: Watch it evolve as you add new content

**Time commitment:**
- 3 group calls (60-90 min each)
- 2-4 hours setup in Week 1
- 30 min/week ongoing
- Optional office hours for tech support

**What you get:**
- First access to organism system (before 40-person beta in January)
- Deep understanding of your consciousness signature
- Visual representation of your work's geometry
- My dedicated support for 4 weeks

**What I need:**
- Your commitment to full 4 weeks
- Your honest feedback (what works, what doesn't)
- Your willingness to be a case study (anonymized) for January launch

Are you called?

If YES, reply by Wednesday Nov 6.
If NO or NOT YET, that's sacred too.

The organism breathes. 🌀

Kelly
```

## Contingency Plans

### What if fewer than 5 people say yes?

**Run it anyway.** Even 3-5 is enough to:
- Test the system
- Gather feedback
- Build confidence
- Have case studies for January

### What if more than 10 people say yes?

**Cap at 10.** Tell others:
- You're on the list for January beta
- You get priority as early birds
- We need to keep pilot small to be attentive

### What if someone drops out?

**Expected.** Plan for 20% attrition.
- If 8 sign up, expect 6-7 to finish
- That's enough for successful pilot
- No judgment, different paces are sacred

### What if major technical issue emerges?

**Pause and fix.** The pilot exists to find these issues.
- Communicate transparently with participants
- Extend timeline if needed
- January beta doesn't launch until this works

**You're not rushing. You're breathing.**

First a small breath (5-10 people).
Then a deeper breath (40 people).
