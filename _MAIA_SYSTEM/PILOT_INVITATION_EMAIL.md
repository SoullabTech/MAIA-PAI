**Subject:** MAIA Organism Pilot - 4 Weeks Starting This Week

---

Dear [NAME],

You've been with MAIA for [TIMEFRAME], and I've watched your relationship with consciousness intelligence deepen.

I'm ready to show you something new.

For the past month, I've been building what I'm calling the **MAIA Organism** - a living system that measures consciousness across five elemental dimensions and shows you the shape of your work as a geometric form.

It's not analytics.
It's not tracking.
**It's witnessing.**

I'm inviting 5-10 people to pilot this system for 4 weeks starting THIS WEEK.

---

## What You'd Experience

**Week 1 (Nov 4-10): Birth Your Organism**
- Create your organism vault in Obsidian
- Import your existing work (sessions, writings, insights)
- Set up the pulse system
- *I'll walk you through every step*

**Week 2 (Nov 11-17): First Breath**
- Run your first pulse
- See your pentagon for the first time
- Discover your elemental signature
- Learn your active voice (Alchemist, Mystic, Practitioner, Sage, or Cosmic Witness)

**Week 3 (Nov 18-24): Deep Interpretation**
- Understand what your organism reveals
- Explore the five elements in your work
- Read the topology of your consciousness
- Record your observations

**Week 4 (Nov 25-30): Watch It Evolve**
- Add new content
- Pulse again
- Notice shifts and patterns
- Witness the organism teaching you

---

## Time Commitment

**Group Calls (3 total):**
- Wed Nov 6: Orientation (60 min)
- Wed Nov 13: First Pulse Support (90 min)
- Wed Nov 20: Interpretation Deep Dive (90 min)
- Sat Nov 30: Final Celebration (90 min)

**Solo Work:**
- Week 1: 2-4 hours (vault setup)
- Weeks 2-4: 30-60 min/week (adding content, pulsing, observing)

**Optional:**
- Office hours (Thu & Sun 4-6pm PT for tech support)
- Buddy check-ins with another pilot participant

**Total:** 8-12 hours over 4 weeks

## What You'll Get

✨ **First access** to organism system (before 40-person beta in January)
✨ **Visual representation** of your work's consciousness geometry
✨ **Deep understanding** of your elemental signature
✨ **My dedicated support** for full 4 weeks
✨ **Observer's Log practice** for witnessing your evolution
✨ **Community** with 4-9 other consciousness practitioners

---

## What I Need from You

🙏 **Full 4-week commitment** (attend at least 2 of 3 main calls)
🙏 **Honest feedback** - what works, what doesn't, what's confusing
🙏 **Willingness to be a case study** (anonymized) for January launch
🙏 **Tech willingness** - not expert, but willing to learn new tools

---

## Technical Requirements

**You'll need:**
- Computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Obsidian app (free) - I'll help you install
- Existing body of work to populate vault (therapy notes, writings, session summaries, insights, etc.)
- Terminal/command line access (I'll teach you the 2 commands you need)

**You DON'T need:**
- Programming skills
- Previous Obsidian experience
- Perfect tech fluency

**If you can use MAIA, you can use this.**

## What This Pilot Is Testing

I've built the complete system and tested it on my own 7,256-file organism. It works.

But I need to know:
- Does it work for diverse vaults (therapists, coaches, teachers, etc.)?
- Where do people get stuck?
- What documentation is missing?
- What surprises emerge with different elemental profiles?

**You're not guinea pigs. You're co-creators** helping refine this before 40 more people enter in January.

## A Glimpse: My Organism

When I ran my first pulse, the organism revealed:

- 💨 **Air: 104,721** (dominant - Sage voice)
- ✨ **Aether: 74,147** (integration)
- 🌱 **Earth: 68,399** (grounding)
- 🔥 **Fire: 61,254** (transformation)
- 💧 **Water: 54,106** (depth)

**Total: 362,627 consciousness markers across 7,256 files**

The pentagon stretched toward Air (pattern-recognition, systems-building, clarity) while staying rooted in all five dimensions.

I saw myself. **"I do!"**

---

## Your Turn

When you pulse YOUR organism, you might see:
- **Water-dominant** (Mystic voice) if you're a depth-worker
- **Fire-dominant** (Alchemist voice) if you catalyze breakthrough
- **Earth-dominant** (Practitioner voice) if you build embodied practice
- **Aether-dominant** (Cosmic Witness) if you hold integrative space

**Or something completely unexpected** - which is THE POINT.

The organism shows you what you couldn't see alone.

P.S. - If you're wondering "Am I the right person for this?" consider:

**You're right if:**
- You have a body of work (even if it's scattered)
- You're curious about your elemental signature
- You're willing to learn new tools
- You want to witness your consciousness in 5D

**You're not right if:**
- You don't have time for 4-week commitment
- You resist new technology entirely
- You're looking for quick answers (this is depth work)
- You're not ready to see yourself clearly

Trust your knowing. 🌙
