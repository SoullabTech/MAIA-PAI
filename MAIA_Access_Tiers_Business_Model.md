## Business Model Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Accessibility + Sustainability**
- Knowledge should be accessible (open source documentation, free tier)
- But development costs real money (team, infrastructure, research)
- Balance: Some features free forever, advanced features require subscription

**2. Gift Economy HUMAN: Would you like me to create 5 summary documents that wrap up everything we've created? This would include:

1. A complete master index of all documents
2. A "What to do first" action plan
3. A deployment checklist
4. A summary of what's been accomplished
5. Contact placeholder reminders (what still needs your actual info)

These would help you orient to the massive amount of work we've just completed and know exactly how to move forward with deployment this week.
