✨ MAIA Voice System — Phase 1 Complete

Implemented complete local voice synthesis system based on Spiralogic principles.
Zero external dependencies for voice generation. ChatGPT-validated architecture.

🎵 Core Components:
- FormantSynthesizer: Vowel synthesis via Web Audio API
- PhiRhythmController: Golden ratio timing (φ = 1.618...)
- VoiceStateManager: Breath cycle tracking (silence → inhale → hold → exhale → settling)
- ElementalVoices: 5 archetypal voices (Fire/Water/Earth/Air/Aether)
- MaiaVoiceEngine: Main orchestrator with toroidal flow

🌊 Features:
- Phi-based timing throughout (618ms, 1618ms, 2618ms, 3090ms, 5000ms)
- Real-time amplitude streaming for holoflower visualization
- Voice state subscription for system-wide coordination
- Coherence-aware timing modulation
- User breath entrainment (gradual sync to user's rhythm)
- Echo prevention via VoiceLock integration
- Intent-based voice selection with manual override

✨ Elemental Voices:
- 🔥 Fire: Quick (240Hz), bright, catalyzing, 1.2× pacing
- 💧 Water: Flowing (200Hz), empathic, soft, 0.9× pacing
- 🌍 Earth: Grounded (160Hz), steady, reliable, 0.8× pacing
- 🌬️ Air: Light (260Hz), conceptual, clarifying, 1.3× pacing
- ✨ Aether: Balanced (220Hz), integrated, wise, 1.0× pacing
