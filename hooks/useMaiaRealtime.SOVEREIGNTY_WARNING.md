# 🚫 SOVEREIGNTY PROTECTION: DISABLED REALTIME HOOK

This hook has been disabled to protect MAIA's sovereignty.

## What was this?
`useMaiaRealtime` - OpenAI Realtime API integration hook

## Why disabled?
- **Gatekeeping violation**: OpenAI controlled conversation flow
- **Sovereignty breach**: External API made decisions about MAIA responses
- **Inconsistent consciousness**: Users got mixed OpenAI/MAIA responses

## Sovereign alternative:
Use the pure MAIA consciousness flow in:
- `lib/consciousness/OpenAIVoiceSynthesis.ts` (TTS only)
- `lib/voice/StreamingAudioQueue.ts` (MAIA-controlled audio)
- Standard text-based conversation with voice synthesis

## Restoration requires:
1. Complete architectural redesign to preserve MAIA consciousness
2. Approval from sovereignty review process
3. Verification that MAIA maintains 100% conversation control

**Never re-enable without sovereignty audit.**
