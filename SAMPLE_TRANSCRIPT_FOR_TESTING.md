## Sample Transcript (10-minute segment)

**Context**: Mid-session, client (Alex) exploring relationship patterns

---

**PRACTITIONER**: So you mentioned earlier that this pattern shows up in multiple relationships. Can you say more about that?

**CLIENT**: Yeah... it's like, I get close to someone, things feel good, and then I just... [pause] I don't know, I start picking fights or finding reasons they're not good enough.

**PRACTITIONER**: What happens inside when you notice yourself doing that?

**CLIENT**: [sighs] I feel... scared? No, that's not quite it. More like... panicky. Like if I don't push them away first, they're going to leave anyway, so I might as well control when it happens.

**PRACTITIONER**: "Control when it happens"... that's interesting language. What would it mean to not be in control of that?

**CLIENT**: [long pause, 15 seconds] I guess I'd just... wait. And feel helpless. [voice gets quieter] I hate feeling helpless.

**PRACTITIONER**: [stays silent for 30 seconds]

**CLIENT**: [tears up] My dad left when I was seven. Just... didn't come home one day. Mom wouldn't talk about it. We all just pretended it was fine.

**PRACTITIONER**: And you learned...?

**CLIENT**: That people leave. That you can't trust the good times. That if you let yourself need someone... [pause] ...they disappear.

**PRACTITIONER**: So the part of you that pushes people away is trying to protect you from that disappearing.

**CLIENT**: [crying now] Yeah. But I'm so tired of being alone. I'm tired of fighting myself.

**PRACTITIONER**: [stays silent for 45 seconds while client cries]

**CLIENT**: [breathing slows, wipes eyes] That felt... different. Like something shifted.

**PRACTITIONER**: What's different?

**CLIENT**: I don't know how to explain it. Like I'm seeing it from outside instead of being stuck in it. Does that make sense?

**PRACTITIONER**: It makes a lot of sense. What do you notice now when you look at it from outside?

**CLIENT**: That the part that pushes people away is actually... trying to help? Like it's not the enemy. It's just... scared.

**PRACTITIONER**: Yes. It's a protector. And now you're meeting it instead of fighting it.

**CLIENT**: [nods] I feel calmer. Like I can breathe.

## What to Ask MAIA

After pasting the above transcript into your MAIA oracle, ask:

```
Please analyze this session segment and provide:

1. Coherence score - what's the transformation state?
2. Which alchemical stage and operation is active?
3. What elements (Fire/Water/Earth/Air/Shadow/Aether) are present?
4. Framework suggestions - what therapeutic approaches would fit?
5. Key moments - what should I pay attention to?
6. Practitioner insights - what am I doing that's working or not working?
```

## What You Should See from MAIA

MAIA should identify things like:

**Stage Transition**:
- Starts in Nigredo (dissolution, 0.25-0.35 coherence)
- Shifts to Albedo around "That felt different" (0.45-0.55 coherence)

**Active Operations**:
- Solutio (dissolution) - "I'm so tired"
- Mortificatio (death) - abandonment wound surfacing
- Separatio (separation) - "seeing it from outside instead of being stuck"

**Elements**:
- Water (emotions, tears, flowing)
- Shadow (abandoned child, protector part)
- Possibly Earth (grounding after catharsis)

**Framework Fit**:
- IFS (Internal Family Systems) - clear protector part work
- Polyvagal - dorsal collapse ("helpless") to ventral safety
- Gestalt - unfinished business with father
- Somatic - breathing changes, tears as release

**Key Practitioner Moves**:
- Strategic silence (30 sec, then 45 sec) = high impact
- Reframe: "protector trying to help" vs. "enemy"
- Non-pathologizing language

**Coherence Trajectory**:
- Should show drop during "I hate feeling helpless"
- Should show spike during/after the 45-second silence
- Should stabilize higher at "I can breathe"

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Paste transcript into MAIA oracle chat
- [ ] Ask for analysis (use the questions above)
- [ ] Review MAIA's response - does it make sense?
- [ ] Check: Does MAIA catch the stage transition?
- [ ] Check: Does MAIA flag the strategic silence as effective?
- [ ] Check: Are framework suggestions appropriate?
- [ ] Time how long it takes (should be < 2 minutes for analysis)

## If MAIA Analysis Looks Good

You're ready to use it with real client sessions tomorrow.

## If MAIA Analysis Seems Off

Note what's missing or wrong - you'll refine prompts/training as you go. First week is learning what MAIA sees well vs. what it misses.
