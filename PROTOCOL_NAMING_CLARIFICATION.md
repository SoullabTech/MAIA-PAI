# Protocol Naming & Attribution Clarification

## ✅ ONE Protocol, Clear Roles

### Dr. Angela's Protocol
**Medical + Clinical + Spiritual Integration**
**Built on the Spiralogic Developmental Framework**

---

## 🎯 The Roles

### Dr. Angela Economakis, MD
**Role:** Protocol Discovery & Implementation (Medical + Clinical + Spiritual)

**What Dr. Angela Contributes:**

**1. Medical/Neurochemical:**
- Integration of Dr. Mindy Pelz's research on menopause brain rewiring
- Hormonal → neurochemical pathways (estrogen → serotonin, dopamine, GABA, etc.)
- CRITICAL CORRECTION: Late luteal despair = DROPPING hormones (withdrawal), not high
- Medical validation and accuracy

**2. Clinical Observations:**
- Pattern observed with her female clients (40s)
- Same problem → Despair in luteal phase → Optimistic in follicular phase
- "Pure presence, no deep diving" clinical approach
- "Center vs. off-center" framework
- "Insights come AFTER hormones shift, not DURING"
- Amplification in perimenopause and PCOS

**3. Spiritual/Developmental:**
- Death/rebirth process
- Elder wisdom emergence
- Transformation, not pathology
- The dropping hormones serve a PURPOSE (shedding "put others first" programming)
- Esoteric & metaphysical wisdom

**Dr. Angela's Quote:**
> "I don't even really engage on anything that would resemble real deep diving at all during such sessions. It's really about acknowledgment of how hard it is to experience those emotions, those intrusive thoughts, that low mood, pessimism, anxiety of familiar themes haunting her, and that she really doesn't have something MORE she needs to do in that session, other than take measures to take care of herself in a very loving way without judgment, analysis, searching, fixing etc."

### Kelly Nezat
**Role:** Spiralogic Developmental Framework & Platform Architect

**What Kelly Contributes:**
- The Spiralogic model that MAIA is built on
- A developmental framework that invites ALL levels of wisdom:
  - Medical
  - Clinical
  - Spiritual
  - Earth-clinical
- Platform architecture that can hold cyclical understanding
- Container for integrating multiple ways of knowing
- The foundation that makes this integration possible

**Kelly's Vision:**
> "A platform that invites all levels of wisdom, including earth-clinical"

## 🧬 How They Work Together

### Dr. Angela's Protocol WITHIN Kelly's Spiralogic Framework

**Kelly built the platform** (Spiralogic developmental model)
**Dr. Angela discovered and implements the protocol** (medical + clinical + spiritual layers)

**Analogy:**
- Kelly built the HOUSE (Spiralogic framework)
- Dr. Angela designed and lives in a ROOM (the cycle-aware protocol)
- The room couldn't exist without the house
- The house gains power from what happens in the room

## ⚡ The Fundamental Insight

### This Is About ALL Women Who Cycle (Not Just Perimenopause)

**Dr. Angela's Critical Point:**
> "It's a fundamental chemical difference between men and women: we are cyclical as defined by our hormones, men are not. They don't have this endocrine function in this way."

**What this means:**
- **Women are CYCLICAL** (neurochemistry changes monthly)
- **Men are LINEAR** (no hormonal cycling)
- **The world is built for linear humans**
- **Women are forced to perform as linear when they're fundamentally cyclical**

**Market:** ALL women who cycle (not just perimenopause) = 50% of world's population

## 🚀 What This Means for MAIA

**MAIA offers something that doesn't exist anywhere else:**

1. **Medical accuracy** (Dr. Pelz's research + Dr. Angela's validation)
2. **Clinical wisdom** (Dr. Angela's observations with clients)
3. **Spiritual depth** (Dr. Angela's death/rebirth, elder wisdom framework)
4. **Developmental container** (Kelly's Spiralogic model that holds it all)
5. **Real-time adaptation** (AI conversation that shifts by cycle phase)
6. **Recognition of cyclical nature** (not forcing women to be linear)

**No period tracker app does this.**
**No therapist has all three layers.**
**No AI has this integration.**
