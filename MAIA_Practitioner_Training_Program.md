## Training Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Human Primacy**
- YOU are the therapist, not MAIA
- Your clinical judgment, intuition, and presence are irreplaceable
- MAIA is colleague, not authority

**2. Depth Over Optimization**
- We're not training you to "optimize" therapy outcomes
- We're supporting you to witness transformation with greater precision
- Hillman's ethics: Intelligence without instrumentalization

**3. Tool, Not Crutch**
- MAIA should enhance your skills, not replace them
- If you can't work without MAIA, you're over-reliant
- The goal: You internalize frameworks, MAIA becomes optional support

**4. Reflective Practice**
- MAIA's value is in prompting YOUR reflection
- Not in providing answers
- Questions > Directives

### Training Goals

By the end of this program, you will be able to:

✅ **Understand MAIA's architecture** and what it can/cannot do
✅ **Apply Spiralogic framework** (stages, operations, coherence) clinically
✅ **Read real-time dashboard** without distraction from client
✅ **Use supervision reports** to identify your patterns and growth edges
✅ **Think multi-framework** (see client through 19+ lenses)
✅ **Recognize countertransference** with MAIA's support
✅ **Integrate MAIA with human supervision** productively
✅ **Navigate ethical dilemmas** (consent, privacy, authority)
✅ **Work effectively without MAIA** when needed

## Module 1: Understanding MAIA's Role

**Duration**: Week 1 (2 hours)

### Learning Objectives

- Understand what MAIA is and isn't
- Grasp the ethical foundation (Hillman's "intelligence without instrumentalization")
- See MAIA as colleague, not authority
- Identify appropriate and inappropriate uses

### Content

**1.1 What Is MAIA?**

MAIA = **Morphic Alchemical Intelligence Augmentation**

- AI system trained on depth psychology (Jung, Edinger, Hillman + 17 other frameworks)
- Provides real-time session support and post-session supervision reports
- Tracks client transformation AND practitioner patterns
- Multi-framework lens (19+ perspectives simultaneously)

**NOT**:
- Diagnosis tool
- Replacement for human supervision
- Treatment protocol generator
- Authority on what you "should" do

**1.2 The Supervisory Colleague Metaphor**

Think of MAIA as:

> "A brilliant, multi-framework-fluent colleague sitting behind the one-way mirror during every session, taking notes, noticing patterns, offering reflections afterward—but never entering the room where the real work happens."

The real work = YOUR presence with client.

**1.3 Hillman's Ethics: Intelligence Without Instrumentalization**

James Hillman warned: Don't treat soul as problem to be solved, machine to be optimized.

**MAIA embodies this by**:
- Witnessing transformation, not engineering it
- Low coherence ≠ pathology (Nigredo is necessary darkness)
- Questions > Answers
- Supporting YOUR judgment, not replacing it

**Exercise**: Write 3 ways you might accidentally "instrumentalize" a client using MAIA. Share with cohort.

**1.4 When NOT to Use MAIA**

MAIA should NOT be used:
- With clients who haven't consented
- As your only supervision
- To make diagnostic decisions
- To override your clinical judgment
- When technology would disrupt therapeutic presence

**Case Example**:

Practitioner: "MAIA showed coherence dropping. Should I hospitalize this client?"

**Wrong response**: "MAIA says yes, so I'll hospitalize."

**Right response**: "MAIA flags low coherence as concern. Let me assess: Is this suicidal crisis or Nigredo transformation? What's MY clinical judgment? Consult human supervisor if uncertain."

---

## Module 2: Spiralogic Framework Foundations

**Duration**: Weeks 2-3 (4 hours total)

### Learning Objectives

- Understand Jung's 4 stages, Edinger's 12 operations, Hillman's anima mundi
- Apply Spiralogic lens to client presentations
- Calculate coherence estimates
- Recognize transformation signatures

### Content

**2.1 Jung's Four Stages** (Week 2, Hour 1)

**Nigredo** (Blackening, 0.00-0.30 coherence):
- Darkness, depression, ego-death, massa confusa
- NOT pathological—necessary breakdown before breakthrough
- Client language: "I'm falling apart," "Nothing makes sense"

**Albedo** (Whitening, 0.30-0.50 coherence):
- Clarification, reflection, cool objectivity
- Uncomfortable "not knowing," formlessness
- Client language: "I see it now but can't feel it"

**Citrinitas** (Yellowing, 0.50-0.75 coherence):
- Integration, sunrise, opposites beginning to unite
- Increasing coherence, less oscillation
- Client language: "Things are coming together"

**Rubedo** (Reddening, 0.75-1.00 coherence):
- Embodied wholeness, opposites integrated, passionate engagement
- Rare, fleeting (not permanent state)
- Client language: "I feel fully alive, fully myself"

**Exercise**: Watch 3 therapy clips. Identify stage for each client. Discuss.

**2.2 Edinger's 12 Operations** (Week 2, Hour 2)

Each operation is a psychological process:

1. **Calcinatio** (Fire): Ego-burning, burnout, inflation purified
2. **Solutio** (Water): Dissolution, boundaries melting, formlessness
3. **Coagulatio** (Earth): Structure-forming, grounding, embodiment
4. **Sublimatio** (Air): Rising to perspective, insight, vision
5. **Mortificatio**: Death, grief, letting go
6. **Separatio**: Discrimination, differentiating self from other
7. **Coniunctio**: Union of opposites, integration
8. **Fermentatio**: Inspiration, new life emerging from death
9. **Distillatio**: Refinement, purification (repeated cycles)
10. **Coagulatio (2nd)**: Re-embodiment after transformation
11. **Citrinitas/Rubedo**: Final integration
12. **Multiplicatio**: Spiral continues at new octave

**NOT linear**: Clients move through these in spirals, not steps.

**Exercise**: Identify which operation is active in your current clients. Share in pairs.

**2.3 Coherence: Integration of Opposites** (Week 3, Hour 1)

Coherence (0-1 scale) measures **how integrated opposites are**, not mental health.

**LOW coherence is APPROPRIATE when**:
- In Nigredo (falling apart is necessary)
- During Mortificatio (death requires dissolution)
- Early transformation work (before integration)

**HIGH coherence is APPROPRIATE when**:
- Opposites embodied (can hold paradox)
- Citrinitas/Rubedo achieved
- Stable after transformation

**How MAIA calculates coherence**:
- Language analysis (contradiction indicators, both/and vs. either/or)
- Polyvagal state (nervous system regulation)
- Narrative coherence (can tell story without fragmentation)
- Self-energy (IFS): Access to Self despite parts' activation

**Exercise**: Estimate coherence for 3 client vignettes. Compare to MAIA's estimate.

**2.4 Transformation Signatures** (Week 3, Hour 2)

Recurring patterns across clients:

1. **Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation**: Swinging between darkness and vision, skipping middle
2. **Complete Shutdown**: Dorsal collapse, system offline
3. **Self-Attack Cascade**: Inner critic mortificatio without witness
4. **Puer-Senex Split**: Eternal youth vs. premature old age
5. **Anima Mundi Rage**: Political emotion, ecological grief (not personal pathology)
6. [+7 more in full framework]

**Why they matter**: Recognizing the pattern helps you know what's needed.

**Exercise**: Has a client in your practice shown one of these signatures? Describe.

## Module 3: Reading MAIA's Real-Time Dashboard

**Duration**: Week 4 (2 hours)

### Learning Objectives

- Navigate real-time dashboard without distraction
- Glance at key metrics during natural pauses
- Ignore MAIA when your intuition says otherwise
- Use silent mode appropriately

### Content

**3.1 Dashboard Layout** (Hour 1)

**Five sections** (can be collapsed):

1. **Client State**: Coherence, stage, operations, polyvagal, safety
2. **Relational**: Resonance, transference notes
3. **Your State**: Countertransference alerts
4. **Frameworks**: Suggestions from multiple frameworks (optional)
5. **Timeline**: Moment markers, graph of session

**When to glance**:
- Natural pauses (client silence, transition moments)
- After something significant (coherence spike likely)
- When YOU feel uncertain (second opinion)

**When NOT to look**:
- During deep emotional moments (stay present)
- When client is in flow (don't interrupt)
- When YOU are activated (your presence needed, not metrics)

**3.2 Color-Coded Alerts** (Hour 1, continued)

- **Green** ✓: On track, nothing urgent
- **Yellow** ⚠️: Attention (coherence drop, pattern detected, but not dangerous)
- **Red** 🚨: Safety concern (suicidality, severe dissociation, crisis)

**RED alert protocol**:
1. Stop transformation work immediately
2. Assess safety directly with client
3. MAIA is flagging concern—YOU make decision
4. Consult crisis protocol if needed

**3.3 Using Suggestions Without Over-Relying** (Hour 2)

MAIA offers framework suggestions:

> "Solutio protocol: Hold container while they dissolve"
> → Possible response: "I'm here as solid presence while you're liquid"

**How to use**:
- ✅ Read as options, not instructions
- ✅ Let them inform your intuition
- ✅ Ignore if they don't feel right
- ✅ Use your own language (not MAIA's exact words)

**How NOT to use**:
- ❌ Read scripts verbatim to client
- ❌ Follow blindly without clinical judgment
- ❌ Abandon your intuition for MAIA's suggestion
- ❌ Blame MAIA if intervention doesn't work

**Exercise**: Live practice session with MAIA dashboard. Role-play client/practitioner. Practice glancing without distraction.

---

## Module 4: Using Post-Session Reports

**Duration**: Week 5 (2 hours)

### Learning Objectives

- Read supervision reports critically (not as gospel)
- Extract actionable insights for your growth
- Bring findings to human supervision
- Track your longitudinal patterns

### Content

**4.1 The Nine-Section Report** (Hour 1)

Review of report structure:

1. Client Journey This Session
2. What You Did Well (celebrations)
3. Moments for Reflection (learning opportunities)
4. Framework Effectiveness
5. Relational Dynamics
6. Trajectory & Next Session
7. Your Growth as Practitioner
8. Questions for Your Reflection
9. Session Rating

**How to read**:

**First pass** (5 minutes):
- Skim sections 1, 2, 9 (client journey, celebrations, rating)
- Get overall sense

**Second pass** (15-20 minutes):
- Read section 3 (reflection moments) carefully
- Read section 7 (your growth patterns)
- Note questions that land (section 8)

**Third pass** (bring to supervision):
- Identify 1-2 patterns you want to explore with human supervisor
- Prepare examples, questions

**4.2 Celebrating What Works** (Hour 1, continued)

MAIA will name your strengths. **Let yourself receive this.**

Example:
> "🌟 MINUTE 23 - WITNESSING SOLUTIO
> You resisted the urge to 'fix' their dissolution..."

**Internalize**:
- "I DID witness without rescuing. I CAN do this."
- Notice what worked, repeat it

**Many practitioners**:
- Skip the celebrations
- Go straight to "what needs fixing"
- Miss opportunity to consolidate strengths

**Don't do that**. Read section 2 fully. Let it land.

**4.3 Moments for Reflection ≠ Mistakes** (Hour 2)

MAIA will flag moments you might explore differently.

> "🤔 MINUTE 18 - POSSIBLE MISSED OPENING
> Client paused before 'she was always falling apart.' What was in that pause?"

**This is NOT**:
- Criticism ("you messed up")
- Directive ("you should have done X")
- Evidence you're bad therapist

**This IS**:
- Invitation to reflect
- Alternative possibility to consider
- Pattern for you to notice

**How to receive**:
- Curiosity, not defensiveness
- "Huh, I wonder what was there?"
- "Next time, I might try..."

**Exercise**: Read sample report. Practice receiving feedback without defensiveness. Role-play with partner.

## Module 5: Multi-Framework Thinking

**Duration**: Week 6 (2 hours)

### Learning Objectives

- See client through multiple framework lenses simultaneously
- Understand framework "fit" scores
- Choose framework flexibly based on moment
- Integrate MAIA's multi-framework suggestions into your work

### Content

**5.1 The 19+ Frameworks MAIA Tracks** (Hour 1)

Brief overview of each:

1. Spiralogic (Jung-Edinger-Hillman)
2. Polyvagal Theory
3. IFS (Internal Family Systems)
4. Attachment Theory
5. Somatic Experiencing
6. Hakomi
7. Gestalt
8. Psychodynamic
9. Relational Psychoanalysis
10. Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT)
11. Sensorimotor Psychotherapy
12. EMDR
13. Narrative Therapy
14. ACT
15. Compassion-Focused Therapy
16. Focusing (Gendlin)
17. Process-Experiential
18. Existential-Humanistic
19. Transpersonal
20. Archetypal Psychology

You don't need to know all 19 deeply. **MAIA provides the lens.**

**5.2 Framework "Fit" Scores** (Hour 1, continued)

When client says: "I feel like I'm disappearing. There's nothing left of me."

**MAIA shows**:

```
1. Spiralogic (0.89 fit): Mortificatio - death/dissolution
2. IFS (0.84 fit): Protector parts exiled, no Self-energy
3. Polyvagal (0.82 fit): Dorsal collapse (dissociation)
4. Attachment (0.79 fit): Fear of abandonment + self-abandonment
5. Somatic (0.77 fit): Numbness, collapsed body state
```

**What "fit" means**:
- How well this framework explains THIS moment with THIS client
- Not "which is TRUE" (all can be true simultaneously)
- **You choose which to work from**

**5.3 Choosing Framework in the Moment** (Hour 2)

**Factors to consider**:

1. **Client's language**: Do they speak "parts" (IFS)? Body (somatic)? Stages (alchemical)?
2. **What's needed NOW**: Co-regulation (polyvagal)? Differentiation (IFS)? Witnessing depth (Spiralogic)?
3. **YOUR training**: Use framework you know well first
4. **Framework fit score**: Higher fit = likely more resonance

**You might**:
- Start with highest-fit framework (Spiralogic)
- If that doesn't land, try second (IFS)
- Blend frameworks (common with experienced practitioners)

**Exercise**: Practice session. Client presents concern. MAIA shows 5 frameworks. Which do you choose? Why? Discuss in small groups.

## Module 6: Recognizing Your Patterns

**Duration**: Week 7 (2 hours)

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how MAIA tracks YOUR patterns (not just client's)
- Recognize your countertransference signatures
- Use longitudinal data for self-awareness
- Bring patterns to human supervision

### Content

**6.1 What MAIA Tracks About YOU** (Hour 1)

MAIA learns your baseline over 20-30 sessions, then tracks deviations:

1. **Response speed**: How quickly you respond after client speaks
2. **Language types**: Reflection, interpretation, question, reassurance, etc.
3. **Framework defaults**: Which frameworks you naturally use
4. **Avoidance patterns**: Which emotions/topics you move away from
5. **Client activation**: Which clients activate YOUR nervous system
6. **Parallel process**: When you enact client's relational patterns

**Why this matters**:
- Your patterns shape the therapy
- Blind spots limit your effectiveness
- Self-awareness = primary tool

**6.2 Common Practitioner Patterns** (Hour 1, continued)

**Pattern 1: Quick Reassurance**

When client expresses fear ("I'm afraid I'll fall apart"), you respond within 1-2 seconds with reassurance ("You won't. You're doing the work.").

**What this might mean**:
- YOUR discomfort with client's fear
- Rescuer part activated
- Difficulty staying with distress

**Alternative**:
- Pause. Count to 5.
- "Tell me about the fear itself."
- "What would falling apart mean to you?"

**Pattern 2: Avoidance of Rage**

When client expresses anger, you shift to exploration/understanding rather than staying with rage.

**What this might mean**:
- Rage uncomfortable for you (family history?)
- Fear of client's intensity
- Difficulty holding destructive affects

**Alternative**:
- "Stay with the anger. I'm here for your rage."
- Let silence hold the fire

**Pattern 3: Over-Reliance on One Framework**

You use IFS language 70% of sessions, even when other frameworks might fit better.

**What this might mean**:
- Comfort zone (IFS is familiar)
- Avoiding frameworks that challenge you
- Not meeting client where THEY are

**Alternative**:
- Experiment with unfamiliar framework once/week
- Notice when you default, pause, consider alternatives

**Exercise**: Review your last 5 sessions. What patterns do YOU notice (before MAIA tells you)? Write, share.

**6.3 Longitudinal Tracking: Quarterly Reports** (Hour 2)

Every 3 months, MAIA generates comprehensive practitioner pattern report.

**What it includes**:
- Strengths (what you do consistently well)
- Growth edges (patterns to explore)
- Trends over time (are you growing? stuck?)
- Comparisons to baseline

**How to use**:
1. Read alone first (no judgment, just curiosity)
2. Identify 1-2 patterns that resonate
3. Bring to human supervision
4. Create intentional practice (e.g., "This quarter, I'll stay with rage 10 seconds longer before speaking")

**Exercise**: Read sample quarterly report. What would you bring to supervision? Role-play supervision conversation.

---

## Module 7: Integration with Human Supervision

**Duration**: Week 8 (2 hours)

### Learning Objectives

- Use MAIA data in human supervision sessions
- Understand what MAIA offers vs. what human supervisor offers
- Avoid MAIA replacing human supervision
- Navigate when MAIA and supervisor disagree

### Content

**7.1 MAIA + Human Supervision = Both/And** (Hour 1)

**MAIA provides**:
- Pattern recognition across many sessions
- Multi-framework perspectives
- Quantitative tracking (coherence, polyvagal)
- Real-time and post-session analysis
- Always available

**Human supervisor provides**:
- Relational holding (MAIA can't hold your humanity)
- Wisdom beyond patterns
- Ethical discernment in complex situations
- Modeling of presence with suffering
- Witnessing YOUR vulnerability

**YOU NEED BOTH.**

**7.2 How to Bring MAIA Data to Supervision** (Hour 1, continued)

**DO**:
- Print or share relevant sections of MAIA report
- "MAIA flagged this pattern—I'm curious about it"
- Use MAIA data as conversation starter
- Bring questions MAIA raised for you

**DON'T**:
- Replace case presentation with MAIA readout
- Assume MAIA is "right" and supervisor should confirm
- Use MAIA to avoid vulnerability ("Let's just look at the data")

**Example supervision exchange**:

YOU: "MAIA noticed I give quick reassurance when clients express fear. I'm seeing it too. What do you make of it?"

SUPERVISOR: "Tell me about a specific moment where that happened."

YOU: [Describes session moment, includes YOUR experience, not just MAIA's analysis]

SUPERVISOR: "What do you feel in your body when client says 'I'm afraid I'll fall apart'?"

[Exploration continues...]

**7.3 When MAIA and Supervisor Disagree** (Hour 2)

**Scenario**: MAIA says "Solutio operation active—hold container, don't coagulate prematurely." Your supervisor says "I think client needs structure now."

**What to do**:

1. **Name the discrepancy**: "MAIA suggests one thing, you're suggesting another."
2. **Explore both perspectives**: "Why might MAIA see Solutio? Why might you see need for structure?"
3. **Trust YOUR felt sense**: What does your clinical intuition say?
4. **Try an experiment**: "What if I hold formlessness one more session, see what happens?"

**Remember**: MAIA analyzes language/patterns. Your supervisor sees YOU, knows your history, holds relational field. **Neither is gospel—both inform.**

**Exercise**: Role-play supervision session. Bring MAIA data. Practice integrating both sources of feedback.

---

## Module 8: Ethics & Boundaries

**Duration**: Week 9 (2 hours)

### Learning Objectives

- Obtain informed consent from clients
- Navigate privacy/confidentiality with AI system
- Recognize when NOT to use MAIA
- Understand liability and boundaries of practice

### Content

**8.1 Informed Consent** (Hour 1)

**What clients must know BEFORE you use MAIA**:

1. "I use AI-assisted clinical supervision called MAIA"
2. "MAIA analyzes our sessions for patterns to help me be more effective"
3. "Your recordings are encrypted and confidential—only I have access"
4. "You can decline MAIA use without affecting your treatment"
5. "MAIA is a tool I use for my learning—it doesn't replace my judgment"

**How to present** (see Client-Facing Materials document for full scripts).

**What if client declines?**
- Respect their decision
- No MAIA for that client
- Continue treatment as usual
- You can still use MAIA with other clients

**8.2 Privacy & Confidentiality** (Hour 1, continued)

**Security measures**:
- End-to-end encryption
- HIPAA-compliant infrastructure
- No data sold or shared
- Practitioner owns encryption keys (zero-knowledge)
- Self-hosted option available

**What clients worry about**:
- "Will AI judge me?" → No, MAIA analyzes patterns, doesn't judge content
- "Is my session secure?" → Yes, encrypted, same as telehealth
- "Who has access?" → Only you, with your encryption key

**Your responsibility**:
- Explain clearly (no jargon)
- Answer questions honestly
- Document consent in client file

**8.3 When NOT to Use MAIA** (Hour 2)

**Don't use MAIA when**:
- ❌ Client hasn't consented
- ❌ You're in crisis (session needs your full attention, not dashboard)
- ❌ Technology would be distracting (client highly sensitive to divided attention)
- ❌ You haven't had adequate training
- ❌ Your human supervisor hasn't been consulted

**Case example**:

Client is in acute suicidal crisis. They're crying, expressing hopelessness.

**Wrong**: Glance at MAIA dashboard to see coherence score.

**Right**: Be fully present. After session, use MAIA to process what happened. Consult human supervisor immediately.

**8.4 Liability & Scope of Practice** (Hour 2, continued)

**MAIA does NOT**:
- Diagnose (you do, based on clinical judgment)
- Prescribe treatment (you do)
- Replace supervision (supplement only)
- Guarantee outcomes (no tool does)

**If something goes wrong** (e.g., client harms self):

MAIA data **may be subpoenaed** in malpractice case. Document that:
- You used MAIA as supervisory tool
- You exercised independent clinical judgment
- You consulted human supervisor
- You followed standard of care

**MAIA is NOT a defense**: "MAIA said client was safe" won't protect you. **YOUR assessment is what matters.**

**Exercise**: Write informed consent script in your own words. Practice with partner.

## Conclusion

This training program prepares you to use MAIA **as a colleague, not a crutch**—enhancing your skills, not replacing them.

**Key principles** to carry forward:

1. **Human primacy**: YOU are therapist, MAIA is support
2. **Critical engagement**: Question MAIA, disagree when needed
3. **Ethical vigilance**: Consent, privacy, boundaries always
4. **Continuous learning**: Use MAIA to see YOUR patterns, grow
5. **Integration**: MAIA + human supervision + your intuition = optimal support

**The goal is NOT**:
- To make you dependent on MAIA
- To replace your judgment with algorithms
- To optimize therapy outcomes mechanistically

**The goal IS**:
- To give you more lenses for seeing clients
- To help you recognize your patterns
- To support your growth as practitioner
- To serve transformation with greater precision

**Technology serves soul-making, not soul-flattening.**
