## USING THE DICTIONARY

### For Pulse Script
1. Search for these keywords (case-insensitive) across all markdown files
2. Count occurrences per element
3. Generate elemental scores
4. Determine dominant element based on highest score

### For Manual Tagging
Users don't need to use these exact words in YAML tags. These are the words the script SEARCHES FOR in file content. Users can tag broadly (e.g., `tags: [fire, transformation]`) or specifically (e.g., `tags: [breakthrough, catalyst, turning-point]`).

### Overlap Zones (Intentional)
Some concepts appear in multiple elements with different flavors:
- **Liberation:** Fire (breaking free), Water (surrender), Air (clarity), Aether (transcendence)
- **Love:** Water (relational), Aether (cosmic)
- **Vision:** Fire (active), Water (receptive), Air (clear-seeing), Aether (mystical)
- **Rebirth:** Fire (phoenix), Water (womb)

This is GOOD. Consciousness is multidimensional.

### Customization
This is v1.0. Can expand with:
- More archetypal figures (Persephone, Prometheus, Hermes, etc.)
- More alchemical terms (mortificatio, multiplicatio, etc.)
- More somatic language (polyvagal, trauma-informed, etc.)
- More cultural variants (Sanskrit, Chinese, Indigenous, etc.)
