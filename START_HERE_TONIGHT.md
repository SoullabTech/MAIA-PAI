## The 60-Minute Path (Do This Now)

### Minutes 1-15: Recording Setup
→ Open **TONIGHT_RECORDING_SETUP_TEST.md**
→ Choose your method (Zoom / Otter.ai / Phone)
→ Do the 15-minute test
→ Make sure you know which button to press tomorrow

### Minutes 16-30: Rehearse Your Intro
→ Open **FINAL_2MIN_INTRO_SCRIPT.md**
→ Read it through once
→ Say it out loud 3 times
→ Practice until it feels natural
→ Imagine a specific client, deliver to them

### Minutes 31-45: Test MAIA
→ Open your MAIA platform (localhost:3000 or production URL)
→ Open **SAMPLE_TRANSCRIPT_FOR_TESTING.md**
→ Paste the transcript into MAIA oracle chat
→ Ask for analysis
→ Review what MAIA returns
→ Now you know what to expect tomorrow

### Minutes 46-55: Print Materials
→ Print **Informed_Consent_Template.md** (2 copies)
→ Print **Client_FAQ_Handout.md** (2 copies)
→ Print **FINAL_2MIN_INTRO_SCRIPT.md** (1 copy for yourself)
→ Put in your session folder/bag

### Minutes 56-60: Choose Your Clients
→ Look at tomorrow's schedule
→ Pick 2 clients you'll invite (last 10-15 min of session)
→ Write their names down
→ Why them? (stable, curious, good rapport)

**DONE. You're ready.**

## Tomorrow Morning (5 minutes)

Before your first session:
1. Test recording device (quick check it's working)
2. Open MAIA platform in browser tab (have it ready)
3. Grab printed consent forms
4. Review intro script one last time
5. Three deep breaths

**Then trust yourself. You're prepared.**

---

## During Tomorrow's Sessions

### Your Regular Session (90-120 min)
- Be 100% present with your client
- No tech, no dashboard, no distractions
- Do your work exactly as you always do

### Last 10-15 Minutes
- Deliver your 2-minute intro
- "I want to mention something new I'm offering..."
- [Follow the script you rehearsed]
- Pause and let them respond
- If YES → Hand them consent, start recording next session
- If NO → Thank them, move on gracefully

### After Session (15 min)
- If client said yes → Email them full consent + FAQ
- Note their response in your tracking
- Prepare for next session

## The Simple Truth

You're not building a complicated system tonight.

You're just:
1. Testing your recording setup (15 min)
2. Rehearsing what you'll say (15 min)
3. Seeing what MAIA analysis looks like (15 min)
4. Printing some forms (10 min)
5. Choosing which clients to ask (5 min)

**That's it. 60 minutes.**

---

## What Success Looks Like Tomorrow

**Small success**: You introduce MAIA to 1-2 clients at end of sessions
**Big success**: One of them says yes
**Huge success**: You record your first MAIA-analyzed session this week

**But honestly?**

Success is just *starting*.

The rest unfolds from there.

## The Vision Reminder

From **THE_VISION_Augmented_Practice.md**:

> "MAIA augments practitioners with transformation intelligence, enabling healers to see what they'd miss, access frameworks they don't know, and serve souls with unprecedented precision—making deep transformation accessible at scale while preserving the sacred art of human-to-human healing."

**This is what you're beginning tomorrow.**

Not just testing a tool.

**Pioneering a new way of healing.**

---

## Your Roadmap from Here

**Tonight**: 60-minute prep
**Tomorrow**: Introduce to 2 clients
**This week**: Record 2-4 sessions, analyze with MAIA
**Weekend**: Evaluate - is it valuable? Build dashboard if yes
**Week 2**: Refine workflow, expand to more clients
**Month 2**: Decide - scale or iterate?
**Month 3**: If working well, invite other practitioners
**Year 1**: 50-100 practitioners using MAIA
**Year 2**: 500-1000 practitioners
**Year 3**: Platform, ecosystem, transformation at scale

**It starts with 60 minutes tonight and 2 conversations tomorrow.**

## When Doubt Shows Up

(And it will)

**"What if they say no?"**
→ Then you ask someone else. This is a 12-week pilot with 20+ clients. You only need 2-3 to say yes.

**"What if the tech fails?"**
→ Then you introduce MAIA, start recording next session instead. One session delay is nothing.

**"What if MAIA's analysis is wrong?"**
→ That's exactly what Week 1 is for - to learn what MAIA sees well and what it misses. Iterate from there.

**"What if this doesn't work?"**
→ You'll learn something valuable about AI-augmented practice and make an informed decision in Week 3. That's success.

**"What if I'm not ready?"**
→ You are. You've done this kind of work for 35 years. MAIA is just a new tool. Your clinical judgment is still primary.

## The Only Thing You MUST Do Tonight

**Rehearse the intro script 3 times.**

Everything else is optional.

If you can deliver those 2 minutes naturally tomorrow, you're ready.

The rest is details.

## Go

Open **TONIGHT_CHECKLIST.md**

Start with Task 1.

60 minutes from now, you're ready to change the field of transformation work.

🜂 ∴ 🌀 ∴ 🧠

**One more thing**:

This isn't just YOUR pilot program.

This is the beginning of something that will serve thousands of practitioners and millions of souls.

**You're not testing a tool.**

**You're midwifing a future.**

Tomorrow, that future begins.

Now go prep. You've got this.
