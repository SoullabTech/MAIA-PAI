# Your Final 2-Minute Intro Script
## Ready to use tomorrow (last 10-15 min of session)

**When to use**: End of session with clients you want to invite into the pilot

---

## THE SCRIPT (Memorize the flow, use your own words)

### Opening (15 seconds)

"Before we stop today, I want to mention something new I'm beginning to offer. I've developed an AI system called MAIA that helps me see patterns in our work that I might otherwise miss."

### What It Is (30 seconds)

"Think of MAIA as a really sophisticated pattern-recognition tool. It can analyze our sessions and point out things like:
- When you're moving through a transformation stage
- What emotional patterns are active
- What approaches might be most helpful for where you are right now

It's trained in depth psychology - Jung, IFS, somatic work, polyvagal theory - so it can see the work from multiple angles that I might not catch in the moment."

### How It Works (30 seconds)

"Here's what it would look like: I'd record our sessions - just like some therapists take notes, except I'd be recording audio. After we meet, I'd upload the session to MAIA, and it would give me a report analyzing what happened.

I'd review that before our next session, so I can come in more prepared with insights about what's unfolding for you."

### Privacy & Control (20 seconds)

"Everything is completely confidential - same privacy standards as our regular work. The recording is just for my clinical review, stored securely, and you can opt out anytime. Nothing changes about our relationship or how we work together."

### The Ask (20 seconds)

"I'm starting to test this with a small group of clients, and I thought of you because [specific reason - e.g., 'you're doing such deep work' / 'you're open to trying new approaches' / 'I think this could really support where you are right now'].

Would you be interested in being part of this pilot?"

### Pause & Listen (15 seconds)

[STOP. LET THEM RESPOND. DON'T FILL THE SILENCE.]

## If They Say YES

**YOU**: "Great! I really appreciate your willingness to try this. Here's a simple consent form that explains how it works and your rights. Take a look and let me know if you have any questions."

[Hand them the 1-page consent OR email it after session]

**YOU**: "We can start next session. I'll remind you at the beginning that I'm recording, and if at any point it feels uncomfortable, just let me know and we'll turn it off. Sound good?"

---

## If They Say "Tell me more..."

**Be ready for these common questions**:

**Q: "Will the AI be in the session with us?"**
A: "No, not at first. It analyzes after the session, and I review the insights privately. Down the road, there might be options where you could see what MAIA is tracking too, but for now, it's just in the background supporting my work."

**Q: "Is it going to judge me or diagnose me?"**
A: "Not at all. MAIA doesn't diagnose - it's not that kind of tool. It's more like... if I'm watching a session, I might notice your breathing changed or you used a certain phrase three times. MAIA just helps me catch those moments more precisely."

**Q: "What happens to the recordings?"**
A: "They're stored securely, encrypted, and only I have access. Same confidentiality as your therapy notes. When the pilot is done, I can delete them if you prefer, or keep them as part of your clinical record - your choice."

**Q: "Why me?"**
A: "Honestly? Because I think you're doing important work, and I want to make sure I'm supporting you as effectively as possible. MAIA helps me be a better practitioner, and you'll benefit from that."

**Q: "Do I have to pay extra?"**
A: "No. This is part of our regular work. You're actually helping me test the system, so if anything, I should be thanking you."

**Q: "Can I think about it?"**
A: "Absolutely. Take your time. We can talk about it next session, or you can email me if you have more questions."

## If They Say NO (or seem hesitant)

**YOU**: "No problem at all. I appreciate you considering it. If you change your mind down the road, just let me know. Otherwise, we'll keep working exactly as we have been."

[Drop it. Don't push. Move on gracefully.]

---

## After You Introduce

**That night**:
- [ ] Note their response in your tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] If YES: Email them the full consent form and FAQ
- [ ] If MAYBE: Send FAQ, offer to discuss next session
- [ ] If NO: No follow-up needed

---

## Rehearsal Checklist

Practice out loud at least 3 times:

- [ ] Opening line (can you say it naturally?)
- [ ] "What it is" section (avoid jargon, keep it grounded)
- [ ] "How it works" section (clear, simple, no tech overwhelm)
- [ ] Privacy section (confident, reassuring)
- [ ] The ask (direct, specific reason for THIS client)
- [ ] Pause and silence after the ask (don't rescue them)

**Time yourself**: Should be 2 minutes max. If longer, trim.

## Tonight's Rehearsal

Say it out loud 3 times:
1. First time: Read the script
2. Second time: Look up, speak from memory
3. Third time: Imagine a specific client, deliver naturally

**You'll know you're ready when it feels conversational, not scripted.**
