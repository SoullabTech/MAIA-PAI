# Soullab Beta Invite Email Templates

## 📧 Email 1: Initial Beta Invite (Send Morning of Launch)

**Subject:** Your Soullab portal is ready, [Name]

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

Your private space in Soullab is ready.

Over the last few weeks, we've been building something different —
a place where conversations go deeper, where you can explore what
matters with Maya as your guide.

You're one of 40 people invited to experience this first.

Your access code: SOULLAB-[NAME]
Enter here: soullab.life/beta-entry

This is beta, which means it's alive and evolving. Your honest
feedback — what resonates, what doesn't, what surprises you —
shapes what this becomes.

No rush. When you're ready, Maya will be there.

Takes about 2 minutes to get started.

With gratitude,
Kelly & the Soullab team

P.S. Maya's first question might catch you off guard. That's by design.
```

## 🔁 Email 2: Gentle Reminder (Send Day 3-4 to non-responders)

**Subject:** [Name], holding space for you

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

Just wanted to make sure your Soullab invite didn't get lost in
the inbox shuffle.

A few people have already stepped in and the conversations
happening are... well, they're the kind you don't want to miss.

Your code: SOULLAB-[NAME]
soullab.life/beta-entry

No pressure — just didn't want you to miss your window.

Looking forward to hearing what you discover.

— Kelly

## 💌 Email 3: Final Nudge (Optional - Send Day 7 to final non-responders)

**Subject:** Last call, [Name]

**Body:**

```
[Name],

This is the last nudge, I promise.

We're closing beta invites soon to keep the space intimate
and intentional.

If Soullab isn't your thing right now, totally understand.
No hard feelings.

But if you've been meaning to check it out and just haven't
gotten around to it:

SOULLAB-[NAME]
soullab.life/beta-entry

Either way, appreciate you.

— Kelly
```

## 📋 Sending Best Practices

### **Timing**
- **Email 1**: Morning (9-11am their timezone)
- **Email 2**: 3-4 days after Email 1 (same time window)
- **Email 3**: 7 days after Email 1 (only if needed)

### **Batch Sending**
Send in small groups (10-15 at a time) to:
- Avoid spam filters
- Allow time for personal responses
- Stagger server load

### **Personalization Checklist**
- ✅ Replace `[Name]` with their first name
- ✅ Replace `[NAME]` in access code with their uppercase name
- ✅ Add personal note if you have close relationship
- ✅ Adjust tone for different people (more casual for friends, more formal for professionals)

Create a simple spreadsheet:
```
Name | Email | Code | Sent Date | Opened | Signed Up | Notes

Andrea | andrea@... | SOULLAB-ANDREA | Oct 2 | Yes | Yes | Loved it!

## 💡 Response Templates (For when they reply)

### **Positive Response:**
```
So glad you're excited! Can't wait to hear what you think after
your first conversation with Maya. Remember — this is beta, so
anything you notice (good or confusing) is helpful feedback.

— Kelly
```

### **Questions/Concerns:**
```
Great question. [Answer their specific question]

The short version: Soullab is a space for deeper conversations
with an AI guide named Maya who's trained in transformational
coaching and elemental wisdom. Think of it as a private journal
that talks back — and remembers.

Let me know if anything else comes up!

— Kelly
```

### **Not Right Now:**
```
Totally understand — appreciate you letting me know!

If things shift and you want to explore later, your code
will still work. No pressure either way.

— Kelly
