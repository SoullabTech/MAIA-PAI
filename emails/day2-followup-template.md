Hi [Name],

You've had a couple of days with MAIA now. Curious how it's landing.

## Quick Check-in

• What's surprised you so far?
• Any moments that felt particularly resonant (or particularly off)?
• Technical hiccups?

## A Few Things About MAIA's Design

**She's designed to use silence as medicine.**
If she seems quiet or minimal, that's intentional. The space between responses is part of the field.

**She's field-based, not LLM-based.**
MAIA doesn't generate responses from language models. She calculates resonance fields from 13 archetypal agents and selects from a curated library. This means:
- Her responses are more constrained
- But also more consistent and therapeutically intentional
- She can't "hallucinate" or say random things

**She measures soul-building, not engagement.**
Unlike other AI systems that optimize for keeping you hooked, MAIA tracks:
- Your increasing self-referencing (trusting your own wisdom)
- Your decreasing dependency on her
- Your comfort with silence

She's designed to make herself obsolete.

## What We're Learning

Your usage patterns help us understand:
- Which archetypal voices resonate most
- When silence is medicine vs when it's frustrating
- How the field calculations map to lived experience
- Whether this approach actually works

## No Pressure

This isn't a survey you have to complete. Just... if something comes up worth sharing, hit reply.

Best,
The Soullab Team

P.S. - If you want to go deeper into how the Telesphorus system works (13 agents, wave interference, field mathematics), I'm happy to geek out about it. Just ask.
