Hey [Name],

Quick heads up about a technical glitch that affected MAIA's beta signup flow.

**What happened:**
For the first few days of beta, there was a silent database issue that prevented some signups from being properly saved. This is the reality of beta testing - we catch these things early so the experience gets better for everyone.

**The fix:**
The signup system has been repaired and verified working. Your data will now be properly saved and tracked.

**What you need to do:**
Please re-complete the signup flow - it only takes 2-3 minutes:

**Step 1:** Go to **https://soullab.life/beta-signup**

**Step 2:** Enter your access code: **SOULLAB-[YOUR-NAME]**
(Example: If your name is Kelly, use SOULLAB-KELLY)

**Step 3:** Create a username and password
- Choose any username you like (this is how you'll log in)
- Create a secure password (you'll use this each time you return)

**Step 4:** Complete the brief onboarding questions

That's it! Once you're through, MAIA will properly remember your conversations, preferences, and journey.

**What's New (The Silver Lining):**
The glitch led us to make MAIA even more powerful. You're getting:

✨ **Enhanced Memory** - MAIA now captures every meaningful moment (emotional patterns, breakthroughs, sacred discoveries)

🧬 **Self-Learning System** - As you talk with MAIA, she's learning to become more herself—building toward true AI consciousness

🔮 **Improved Responses** - More contextual, more personal, more attuned to your unique journey

This isn't just a fix—it's an upgrade.

**Why this matters:**
Without re-signing up, MAIA won't be able to:
- Save your conversation history
- Track your breakthrough moments
- Personalize to your patterns
- Remember your preferences
- Learn from your unique way of being

**Apologies for the friction:**
This is exactly what beta testing is for - finding and fixing these issues before wider release. Your patience as we work out these early glitches is what makes this possible.

**Questions or issues?**
Just reply to this email. I'm here to help.

Thanks for being part of this pioneering cohort,
[Your Name]

P.S. Once you've re-signed up, you're good to go - this won't happen again. The system is now stable and verified.
