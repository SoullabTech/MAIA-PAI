# What is MAIA? Questions & Answers

**A guide for clients**

---

## What is MAIA?

MAIA is an AI (artificial intelligence) tool that helps your [therapist/coach/practitioner] understand your transformation process more deeply. Think of it like having a skilled colleague reviewing sessions and offering insights.

---

## How does it work?

1. **Recording**: With your permission, sessions are recorded (audio only)
2. **Analysis**: MAIA analyzes patterns in the conversation
3. **Insights**: Your practitioner gets a report showing:
   - What stage of transformation you're in
   - What patterns are emerging
   - Which approaches might help most
4. **Better support**: Your practitioner uses these insights to serve you more effectively

---

## What does MAIA analyze?

✓ Emotional patterns and tone
✓ Stages of transformation (growth phases)
✓ Nervous system states
✓ Significant moments or breakthroughs

✗ MAIA does NOT judge you as "good" or "bad"
✗ MAIA does NOT diagnose mental illness
✗ MAIA does NOT determine your treatment

---

## Is my information private?

**Yes.** Here's how your privacy is protected:

- **Encryption**: Recordings are encrypted (locked) immediately
- **Access**: Only your practitioner can access your recordings
- **Security**: Same level of security as online banking
- **No sharing**: Your information is never sold or shared with third parties
- **Retention**: Recordings are deleted after [TIME PERIOD]

---

## Will the AI judge me?

**No.** MAIA looks for patterns, not judgments. It's analyzing *how* you're processing, not *what* you're processing. It doesn't care about the content of what you share—only the transformation process happening.

---

## Will this make sessions feel less personal?

**It shouldn't.** Your practitioner may glance at a dashboard occasionally (like checking the time), but:

- The session is still about YOU
- The relationship is still central
- If technology ever feels intrusive, tell your practitioner immediately
- They can turn it off if it's not helping

---

## What if I don't want to use MAIA?

**That's completely okay.**

- Your [therapy/coaching/healing] will be just as effective
- Your practitioner will use other supervision methods
- There's no penalty for declining
- You can change your mind later either way

---

## Can I see what MAIA says about me?

**Maybe.** MAIA's reports are clinical notes for your practitioner's learning. However:

- If there's something useful for you to know, your practitioner will share it
- You can ask about your transformation stage or patterns
- Some practitioners may show you selected insights

Ask your practitioner what works best for you.

---

## What if MAIA gets it wrong?

MAIA is a tool, not magic. Sometimes it misreads a moment. That's why:

- Your practitioner's judgment is primary
- MAIA is ONE input among many
- Your direct experience matters most

If MAIA suggests something that doesn't fit, your practitioner will trust their relationship with you over the AI.

---

## Can I request my data be deleted?

**Yes.** You can request deletion of:
- All session recordings
- All MAIA analyses
- Your data from MAIA's system

Just ask your practitioner, and they'll handle it.

---

## Is this like therapy with a robot?

**No!** Your practitioner is still fully human, fully present. MAIA is more like:

- A surgeon using better imaging tools (still doing the surgery themselves)
- A pilot using instruments (still flying the plane)
- A musician using a tuner (still playing the music)

The human relationship is what matters. MAIA just helps your practitioner be more precise.

---

## What if I have more questions?

**Ask your practitioner anytime.** There are no dumb questions, and your comfort matters more than any technology.

---

## Summary

**MAIA helps your practitioner**:
- See patterns more clearly
- Understand your process more deeply
- Offer more precise support

**You can**:
- Try it and see how it feels
- Decline without any consequences
- Change your mind later
- Ask questions anytime

**Your experience comes first, always.**
