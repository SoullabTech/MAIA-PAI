## What is MAIA?

MAIA (Morphic Alchemical Intelligence Augmentation) is an artificial intelligence tool that helps me improve my work with you by analyzing our sessions and providing insights about patterns, transformation stages, and therapeutic approaches.

## How MAIA Works

**Session Recording**:
- With your consent, I will record our sessions (audio only)
- Recordings are encrypted immediately and stored securely
- Only I have access to your recordings

**Analysis**:
- MAIA analyzes the session transcript to identify:
  - Emotional patterns and nervous system states
  - Stages of transformation (based on depth psychology)
  - Which therapeutic approaches might be most helpful
  - Moments of significance or breakthrough

**How I Use It**:
- **During sessions**: I may glance at a dashboard showing real-time information (you won't see this screen)
- **After sessions**: I review MAIA's analysis report to inform our future work
- **Your treatment**: MAIA helps me be more precise and aware, but I make all clinical decisions

## Privacy & Security

**Encryption**: All recordings are encrypted using industry-standard security (same as banking apps)

**Access**: Only I can access your recordings and MAIA analysis. MAIA developers do not see your personal information.

**Storage**: Recordings are stored on HIPAA-compliant servers [OR: "on secure servers meeting industry privacy standards" if wellness track]

**Retention**: I retain recordings for [SPECIFY: 90 days / duration of treatment / etc.], then they are permanently deleted

**Breach Notification**: If there is ever a data breach, I will notify you immediately as required by law

## Your Rights

**You have the right to**:

✓ **Decline** - You may choose not to use MAIA without any impact on the quality of care you receive

✓ **Withdraw Consent** - You may change your mind at any time and ask me to stop using MAIA

✓ **Request Deletion** - You may request that I delete all recordings and MAIA analyses from your file

✓ **Ask Questions** - You may ask me anything about MAIA at any time

✓ **Access** - You may request to see MAIA's analysis (we can discuss what would be most helpful)

## Important Limitations

**MAIA is a tool, not a replacement**:
- It does NOT make diagnoses
- It does NOT determine your treatment plan
- It does NOT replace my professional judgment or human supervision
- All clinical decisions remain mine, informed by my training, experience, and our relationship

**MAIA may make errors**:
- Like any technology, MAIA is not perfect
- I use it as ONE source of information alongside my clinical training
- I will always prioritize my direct experience with you over what MAIA suggests

**Legal subpoenas**:
- In rare cases, your therapy records (including MAIA data) could be subject to legal subpoena
- I will advocate for your privacy to the fullest extent possible
- I cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality if a court requires disclosure

## Risks & Benefits

**Potential Benefits**:
- More precise understanding of your transformation process
- Identification of patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed
- Access to multiple therapeutic frameworks simultaneously
- Enhanced clinical supervision for me

**Potential Risks**:
- Small risk of data breach (despite strong security measures)
- Possibility that technology could feel impersonal (please tell me if this happens)
- My attention might occasionally be divided by the dashboard (I will minimize this)
