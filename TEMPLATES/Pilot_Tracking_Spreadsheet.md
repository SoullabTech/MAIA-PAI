**How to fill out**:
- **Presence (1-10)**: 1 = Very distracted by tech, 10 = Tech invisible
- **Agreement**: High = MAIA matched your assessment, Low = MAIA was off
- **Technical Issues**: Note any glitches, crashes, errors

## Sheet 3: MAIA Report Quality

**Rate each section of MAIA's report for every session (1-5 stars)**

| Date | Client | Client Journey | What You Did Well | Moments for Reflection | Framework Effectiveness | Relational Dynamics | Trajectory | Overall Usefulness |
|------|--------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------|
| 1/28 | A      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐             | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐               | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐              | ⭐⭐⭐              | ⭐⭐⭐⭐         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐           |
| 1/29 | B      | ⭐⭐⭐           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐           | ⭐⭐⭐                 | ⭐⭐⭐                 | ⭐⭐               | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐             |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Use this to identify**:
- Which report sections are most valuable (keep them)
- Which feel like noise (suggest removing or de-emphasizing)

## Sheet 4: Insights Captured

**Document specific moments where MAIA helped**

| Date | Client | What You Missed | What MAIA Caught | How You Used It | Outcome |
|------|--------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| 1/28 | A      | Transition to Albedo | Coherence jump to 0.52 when I stayed silent | Held more silence next session | Client went deeper |
| 2/3  | C      | IFS protector activated | Self-attack pattern signature | Named the critic part | Client had breakthrough |
| 2/10 | B      | Nervous system shutdown | Polyvagal dorsal state (0.00 safety) | Slowed down, co-regulated | Session recovered |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**This becomes your "evidence base"** for MAIA's value.

## Sheet 5: Issues & Feature Requests

**Track bugs, problems, and ideas**

| Date | Issue/Request | Type | Priority | Status | Notes |
|------|--------------|------|---------|--------|-------|
| 1/29 | Audio recording dropped mid-session | Bug | High | Reported to dev team | Need auto-save feature |
| 2/1  | Dashboard too bright, distracting | UX | Medium | Adjusted settings myself | Dark mode would help |
| 2/5  | Coherence scores feel arbitrary | Methodology | High | Requested documentation | Want to understand algorithm |
| 2/7  | Would love group session analysis | Feature Request | Low | Future roadmap | For my group practice |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Priority**:
- **Critical**: Blocks you from using MAIA
- **High**: Significantly impacts value
- **Medium**: Annoying but workable
- **Low**: Nice to have

## Sheet 6: Time Investment

**Track how much time MAIA actually takes**

| Week | Setup/Training | Pre-Session Prep | During Session (distraction) | Post-Session Review | Total Time | Sessions Run | Avg Time/Session |
|------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1    | 180 min       | 0               | 0                          | 0                 | 180 min   | 0           | N/A             |
| 2    | 60 min        | 5 min           | 0                          | 0                 | 65 min    | 0           | N/A             |
| 3    | 0             | 10 min (2 sessions) | 10 min (brief glances) | 45 min (3 reviews) | 65 min | 3 | 22 min/session |
| 4    | 0             | 15 min          | 15 min                     | 60 min            | 90 min    | 4           | 22.5 min/session |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Calculate ROI**:
- Time invested vs. value received
- Does time per session decrease as you get more efficient?
- Is the juice worth the squeeze?

## Sheet 7: Decision Matrix (End of Pilot)

**Use this to decide whether to continue and expand**

### Quantitative Results

| Metric | Target | Actual | Met? |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Sessions completed | 20+ | ___ | ☐ |
| Consent rate | 80%+ | ___% | ☐ |
| Technical success rate | 90%+ | ___% | ☐ |
| MAIA-You agreement | 75%+ | ___% | ☐ |
| Avg presence rating | 7+ | ___ | ☐ |
| Avg review time | <20 min | ___ min | ☐ |
| Client satisfaction | 4+/5 | ___ | ☐ |

### Qualitative Assessment

| Question | Answer (1-3 sentences) |
|----------|----------------------|
| Did MAIA help you see what you'd have missed? | |
| Did it enhance your clinical work? | |
| Was it worth the time investment? | |
| Would you recommend to colleagues? | |
| What needs to change before broader rollout? | |

### Final Recommendation

☐ **PROCEED TO PRACTITIONER BETA** - MAIA is ready for 5-10 colleagues

☐ **CONTINUE PERSONAL USE, DELAY BETA** - Need more refinement first

☐ **PAUSE AND REASSESS** - Significant issues to address

☐ **DISCONTINUE** - Not viable as currently designed

**Reasoning**:
[Write 2-3 paragraphs explaining your decision]
