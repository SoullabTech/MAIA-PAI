# MAIA Introduction Scripts for Clients

**Multiple versions to match your style and client population**

---

## When to Introduce MAIA

**Recommended timing**:
- ☐ During intake (before first session) - if you want it integrated from day 1
- ☐ After 2-3 sessions (once trust is established) - RECOMMENDED for most
- ☐ Mid-treatment (introducing to existing clients) - for current caseload

**Where to introduce**:
- ☐ In writing (email, intake form) - gives them time to process
- ☐ Verbally (last 10 min of session) - allows for immediate questions
- ☐ Both - written first, then discuss in person

## Script 1: Brief & Straightforward (2 minutes)

**Best for**: Clients who prefer concise information, don't need lots of detail

---

**YOU**: Hey [name], I want to tell you about something I'm starting to use in my practice. It's called MAIA—it's an AI tool that helps me be a better therapist. Can I take a couple minutes to explain?

**[Client agrees]**

**YOU**: So basically, with your permission, I can record our sessions and have this AI system analyze them. It's like having a really smart colleague review my work and give me feedback.

It helps me notice patterns I might miss—like what stage of transformation you're in, what your nervous system is doing, which approaches might help most.

Your privacy is protected—everything is encrypted and confidential, just like all our work together.

The important thing is: you don't have to say yes. If you'd rather I not use it, that's totally fine, and it won't change how we work together.

What questions do you have?

**[Pause for questions. See FAQ section below for responses.]**

**YOU**: So what do you think? Does this feel okay to you, or would you prefer I not use it?

---

## Script 2: Detailed & Transparent (4-5 minutes)

**Best for**: Clients who value full understanding, may have anxiety about AI or privacy

---

**YOU**: [Name], there's something I want to discuss with you. I use a technology tool in my practice, and I want to be fully transparent about it and give you complete choice.

**What it is**:
It's called MAIA—an AI system designed for therapists. Think of it like having a supervisor who reviews my sessions and helps me see things I might miss.

**How it works**:
If you agree, I'll record our sessions. After we meet, MAIA analyzes the transcript and generates a report for me. It shows patterns—like whether you're going through a stage of breaking down or integrating, what your nervous system is doing, which therapeutic approaches might fit best.

I might also have it running during our session on my laptop—you wouldn't see the screen, but it would show me real-time information. I'd only glance at it during natural pauses, kind of like checking a map.

**Why I use it**:
Honestly, because I want to be the best therapist I can be for you. MAIA is trained on way more frameworks than any one person can hold. So it's like having 19 expert consultants quietly in the room.

**What it doesn't do**:
It doesn't make decisions for me. It doesn't diagnose you. It doesn't tell me what to do. I'm still the therapist, and our relationship is what matters most. MAIA is just a support tool.

**Your privacy**:
Everything is encrypted—scrambled so only I can access it. MAIA's servers meet the same privacy standards as hospitals. Your data is never sold or shared.

**Your choice**:
This is completely your decision. If you say no, I won't use it, and your therapy will be exactly the same—I'll just use my regular training and supervision like I normally would.

And if you say yes now, you can always change your mind later.

**[Pause. Let them process.]**

**YOU**: What are you thinking? Any questions or concerns?

**[Answer questions. See FAQ below.]**

**YOU**: Take your time deciding. We can talk more about it next session if you want, or you can let me know now. What feels right?

## Script 3: Collaborative & Curious (3 minutes)

**Best for**: Clients who like being partners in treatment, curious about psychology

---

**YOU**: [Name], I wanted to run something by you. I've been using this AI tool called MAIA in my practice, and I'm curious what you think about it.

Basically, it's like having a really smart colleague who reviews my sessions and helps me notice patterns. Some clients find it interesting, some are wary about AI, and I want to know where you land.

**How it works**:
I record our sessions (with your permission), and MAIA analyzes them. It tells me things like "Your client just crossed a threshold into a new processing stage" or "You might have missed something at minute 23." It helps me be more precise in understanding what's happening for you.

I could also use it during sessions—there'd be a dashboard on my laptop that I might glance at, but you wouldn't see it.

**Here's the thing**:
You totally get a say in this. Some clients love that I'm using cutting-edge tools to support them. Others feel weird about AI in therapy, which I totally get.

If you'd rather I not use it with you, I won't, and our work will be just as effective. I just wanted to give you the option.

What's your gut reaction?

**[Listen to their response. If positive, proceed. If hesitant, explore. If negative, respect it.]**

## Script 4: For Existing Clients Mid-Treatment

**Best for**: Introducing MAIA to clients you've already been seeing for weeks/months

---

**YOU**: [Name], I want to tell you about something new I'm starting to experiment with in my practice.

You and I have been working together for [time period] now, and you know I'm always looking for ways to serve you better. I recently started using an AI tool called MAIA that helps me analyze sessions and see patterns I might miss.

**Why I'm bringing it up**:
I've been using it with a few other clients, and it's been really helpful. I wanted to offer you the option to try it, but I also want to make sure you're comfortable.

**What would change**:
If you agree, I'd start recording our sessions and having MAIA analyze them. You probably wouldn't notice much difference—I might glance at my laptop occasionally during sessions, but our work together would feel pretty much the same.

The benefit is I'd get a report after each session that helps me understand your process more deeply. I might catch things I'd otherwise miss.

**What wouldn't change**:
Our relationship, the quality of our work, how much I care about your growth. All of that stays the same. MAIA is just a tool to help me do what we're already doing, but better.

**Your choice**:
You can say yes, no, or "let me think about it." Any of those is fine. I wanted to offer it because I think it could enhance our work, but I also trust you to know what feels right for you.

What questions do you have?

**[Answer questions, get their decision]**

## Script 5: For Coaching/Wellness (Non-Clinical)

**Best for**: Life coaches, healers, spiritual guides (not therapy)

---

**YOU**: [Name], I want to share something I'm exploring in my coaching practice.

I recently started using an AI tool called MAIA that helps me track transformation more precisely. It's designed for coaches and healers to understand the stages of change people go through.

**How it works**:
With your permission, I record our sessions, and MAIA analyzes the patterns. It shows me things like:
- What stage of transformation you're in (e.g., breaking down, clarifying, integrating)
- What your emotional and energetic state is
- Which approaches might support you best

**Important to know**:
This is NOT therapy or mental health treatment. It's a transformation tracking tool for coaching work. If you ever need clinical support, I'll refer you to a licensed therapist.

Your information is kept private—encrypted and confidential, just like everything we discuss.

**Your choice**:
You're welcome to say yes or no. If you decline, our coaching will be just as powerful—I'll just use my intuition and experience like I normally do.

What feels right to you?

## Common Client Questions & Your Responses

### Q: "Is the AI judging me?"

**A**: "No. MAIA analyzes patterns in how you're processing, not the content of what you share. It's like... if you were learning a language, it might say 'You're getting better at grammar,' but it's not judging what you're saying. It's looking at the transformation process, not evaluating you as a person."

---

### Q: "Will this be used against me?"

**A**: "Great question. Your MAIA data is treated exactly like any other therapy record—confidential unless there's a legal or safety reason to share. Insurance doesn't see it. Employers don't see it. It's protected the same way all our work is."

---

### Q: "What if the AI gets it wrong?"

**A**: "That's a real possibility. MAIA is a tool, not magic. Sometimes it misreads a moment. That's why I'm still the [therapist/coach]—I use MAIA as ONE source of information, but I trust my relationship with you and my clinical judgment over anything an algorithm says."

---

### Q: "This feels creepy. Is that weird?"

**A**: "Not weird at all. A lot of people have that reaction to AI, especially in something as personal as [therapy/coaching]. Tell me more—what specifically feels creepy? The recording? The analysis? Something else?"

**[Listen, then address their specific concern. Offer to not use MAIA if discomfort persists.]**

---

### Q: "Will you treat me differently if I say no?"

**A**: "Absolutely not. I've been doing this work for [X years] without MAIA, and I'm good at it. MAIA is an enhancement, not a necessity. If you decline, our work will be just as deep and effective. Your comfort and trust come first."

---

### Q: "How does this help me?"

**A**: "Honestly, it mostly helps ME be better at helping you. Specifically:
- I notice patterns faster, so we don't waste time wandering
- I catch things I might miss, like when you're shutting down and I don't realize it
- I get suggestions from multiple approaches, so I can offer what fits YOU
- I see my own blind spots, so my stuff doesn't get in the way of your growth

It doesn't guarantee anything, but it's like a surgeon using better imaging—helps me see more clearly."

---

### Q: "Can I see what it says about me?"

**A**: "MAIA's reports are clinical notes for my learning, so I don't usually share them directly. BUT—if there's something in a report that would be valuable for you to know, I'd definitely share it. Or if you're curious about your process, I can explain what MAIA noticed. Does that work for you, or would you want to see the actual reports?"

## After They Consent: Next Steps

**YOU**: "Great, thank you for being open to trying this. Here's what happens next:

1. I'll have you sign this consent form—take your time reading it
2. Starting [next session / today], I'll record our sessions
3. You probably won't notice much difference, but if you do, tell me
4. After a few sessions, I'll check in with you about how it's feeling
5. If at any point it doesn't feel right, just say the word and we'll stop

Sound good?"

**[Give them consent form, answer any final questions, proceed]**

---

## After They Decline: Next Steps

**YOU**: "Thank you for being honest about that. I really respect your decision.

Just so you know:
- This doesn't affect our work together AT ALL
- You can always change your mind later if you get curious
- I appreciate you taking the time to consider it

Anything else you want to talk about, or should we move on?"
