# Session Notes - March 15, 2024

## Presenting Issue
Client arrived carrying intense grief from recent loss. Been holding it tightly, afraid to let it flow.

## What Emerged

### The Turning Point
Midway through session, client made contact with the grief somatically. Felt it in chest, throat, belly. The holding began to soften.

"I don't have to be strong all the time."

This was the breakthrough.

### The Flow
Once permission was given, tears came. Not brief crying, but deep oceanic release. 20+ minutes of allowing the water to move through.

Client reported feeling the body "unclench" for first time in months.

### Integration
After the crying subsided, we sat in silence. Client noticed:
- Breath deeper
- Shoulders dropped
- Sense of spaciousness in chest
- "I can feel my heart again"

## Reflection

This was transformation through surrender. Fire (breakthrough moment) AND Water (grief release) working together.

The alchemy: Rigidity → Softening → Flow → Integration

Client left different than they arrived. Voice softer. Eyes clearer. Embodied.

## Next Session
Continue witnessing the grief. Let it move at its own pace. No forcing.
