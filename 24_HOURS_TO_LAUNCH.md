# 24 Hours to Launch: Your Action Plan

**Starting sessions tomorrow with MAIA**

*Created: January 26, 2025*
*Your deadline: Tomorrow's first session*

---

## Your Situation

✅ You do BOTH coaching and therapy
✅ You have sessions starting tomorrow
✅ You want to introduce MAIA immediately
✅ You need to move FAST but SMART

---

## TONIGHT: 3-Hour Sprint

### Hour 1: Decisions & Setup (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)

#### Decision 1: Which clients get MAIA first?

**Tomorrow's schedule**:
List your clients for tomorrow:

1. **Client A** - __________ (time)
   - Service type: ☐ Therapy ☐ Coaching
   - Readiness for MAIA: ☐ High ☐ Medium ☐ Low
   - Introduce tomorrow? ☐ YES ☐ NO ☐ WAIT

2. **Client B** - __________ (time)
   - Service type: ☐ Therapy ☐ Coaching
   - Readiness: ☐ High ☐ Medium ☐ Low
   - Introduce tomorrow? ☐ YES ☐ NO ☐ WAIT

3. **Client C** - __________ (time)
   - Service type: ☐ Therapy ☐ Coaching
   - Readiness: ☐ High ☐ Medium ☐ Low
   - Introduce tomorrow? ☐ YES ☐ NO ☐ WAIT

**Recommendation**: Start with 1-2 clients max tomorrow (not all)
- Choose: Most stable, most curious, best relationship

#### Decision 2: Your positioning for each type

**For therapy clients, you'll say**:
```
"I use AI-assisted clinical supervision called MAIA. It helps me
analyze our sessions and be more effective as your therapist."
```

**For coaching clients, you'll say**:
```
"I use AI transformation tracking called MAIA. It helps me see
patterns in your growth journey. This is part of my coaching work,
not therapy or medical treatment."
```

**Document for yourself**:
- With therapy clients, I'm providing: **Clinical mental health treatment**
- With coaching clients, I'm providing: **Personal growth/transformation support**
- I will NEVER blur these lines (insurance/licensing risk)

#### Decision 3: Recording method

**Tomorrow, how will you record?**

☐ **Zoom** (auto-record to cloud)
- Action now: Test that auto-record is enabled
- Check: Consent notice plays at start

☐ **Other telehealth platform** (________)
- Action now: Test recording function
- Verify: Audio quality is good

☐ **Manual phone recording**
- Action now: Download recording app (Voice Memos, Otter.ai, etc.)
- Test: Record 2-min sample, play back

☐ **In-person sessions**
- Action now: Set up phone/recorder in room
- Test: Record from typical client seat distance

**DO THIS NOW** (15 min):
- [ ] Test your recording method
- [ ] Record 2 minutes of yourself talking
- [ ] Play it back - is audio clear?
- [ ] If yes → ready. If no → troubleshoot now.

### Hour 2: Prepare Materials (7:00 PM - 8:00 PM)

#### Task 1: Your Introduction Script (20 min)

**Choose ONE script** from the templates:

For tomorrow, I recommend **Script 1: Brief & Straightforward** (2 min)

**YOUR VERSION** (write it in your own words):

```
[Draft your 2-minute intro here - customize from the template]

"Hey [name], I want to tell you about something I'm starting to
use in my practice..."

[Fill in the rest in YOUR voice]
```

**Practice NOW**:
- [ ] Read it out loud 3 times
- [ ] Record yourself saying it
- [ ] Listen back - does it sound natural?
- [ ] Adjust until it flows

**Time this**: Your intro should be 2-3 minutes max.

#### Task 2: Consent Form - SIMPLIFIED VERSION (20 min)

**For tomorrow ONLY**, use this ultra-simple version:

**Print this tonight:**

---

**VERBAL CONSENT FOR MAIA (Pilot Program)**

**Client**: _____________ **Date**: _______

I consent to the use of MAIA (AI session analysis tool) as described:

☐ **YES - I consent**
☐ **NO - I decline**

Client signature: ________________

Practitioner: ________________

*Full written consent form to follow*

---

**Why this is okay for tomorrow**:
- You'll verbally explain everything (using your script)
- This documents their decision
- You'll provide full consent form by next session

**Action NOW**:
- [ ] Copy the above into a Word doc
- [ ] Print 3 copies (for clients you might introduce to)
- [ ] Put in folder for tomorrow

#### Task 3: Client FAQ - One-Pager (15 min)

**Option A**: Print the template as-is
- [ ] Open `Client_FAQ_Handout.md`
- [ ] Print 3 copies
- [ ] Bring tomorrow to give clients who say yes

**Option B**: Skip for tomorrow
- You can email it to them after the session
- Focus on verbal explanation first

**Recommendation**: Option A (print it now, 5 min)

#### Task 4: Your Tracking System - Simple Version (5 min)

**For tomorrow, just create this simple note template**:

```
SESSION NOTES - MAIA PILOT

Client: [Initial]
Date: [Today's date]
Therapy or Coaching? [Circle one]

BEFORE SESSION:
- Introduced MAIA? Y / N
- Client reaction: ___________
- Consented? Y / N / Still deciding

DURING SESSION:
- Recorded? Y / N
- Any tech issues? ___________

AFTER SESSION:
- Time spent reviewing MAIA report: ___ min
- Key insight from MAIA: ___________
- Will I use this insight next session? Y / N

NEXT STEPS:
- Continue with MAIA? Y / N / Adjust how?
```

**Action NOW**:
- [ ] Copy this into a Google Doc or notes app
- [ ] Duplicate it 3 times (one per potential client)
- [ ] Have it open on your phone/laptop tomorrow

---

### Hour 3: Technical Setup & Rehearsal (8:00 PM - 9:00 PM)

#### Task 1: MAIA Account Setup (30 min)

**If MAIA platform is live**:
- [ ] Go to [MAIA URL]
- [ ] Create account
- [ ] Choose: ☐ Clinical ($299/mo) or ☐ Wellness ($99/mo)
  - **Since you do both, choose Clinical tier** (includes all features)
- [ ] Set up payment
- [ ] Enable two-factor authentication
- [ ] Set retention to 90 days
- [ ] Test with demo upload

**If MAIA platform is NOT live yet** (still in development):
- [ ] Email dev team: "Starting pilot tomorrow, need access"
- [ ] Request beta tester account
- [ ] Get setup instructions
- [ ] MEANWHILE: Record session locally, upload when ready

#### Task 2: Dashboard Quick Setup (15 min)

**If you have access**:
- [ ] Log into MAIA
- [ ] Go to Settings → Dashboard
- [ ] Choose "Minimal View" (less distracting)
- [ ] Set alert threshold: Coherence < 0.20 = Yellow
- [ ] Save preferences

**During tomorrow's session**:
- You can have dashboard open BUT
- Only glance during natural pauses
- If it's too distracting → close it, post-session analysis only

#### Task 3: Final Rehearsal (15 min)

**Right now, practice out loud**:

1. **Your introduction** (2-3 min)
   - Pretend your partner/wall is the client
   - Say your script start to finish
   - Don't overthink, just practice

2. **Answering questions** (5 min)
   - "Is this private?" → [Your answer]
   - "Will it change our work?" → [Your answer]
   - "Can I say no?" → [Your answer]

3. **Getting consent** (2 min)
   - "So what do you think - does this feel okay?"
   - [Pause for response]
   - If yes: "Great, sign here"
   - If no: "Totally understand, no problem at all"

**You're ready when**:
- [ ] You can explain MAIA in 2-3 min without notes
- [ ] You can answer the top 3 questions confidently
- [ ] You feel 7/10 comfortable (don't need 10/10)

## What If Things Go Wrong Tomorrow?

**Scenario 1: Client seems uncomfortable**

**YOU**: "I'm noticing some hesitation. Tell me more about that?"

**[Listen]**

**YOU**: "That makes sense. Let's not use MAIA with you. I want you to feel completely comfortable here."

---

**Scenario 2: Recording fails mid-session**

- Don't panic
- Focus on the client (they're more important than tech)
- After session: Note what happened, troubleshoot
- Next time: Better backup plan

---

**Scenario 3: You forget to introduce it**

- That's okay!
- Introduce next session
- No harm done

---

**Scenario 4: Client says "What does it say about me?"**

**YOU**: "MAIA isn't analyzing you as a person - it's analyzing the transformation process you're going through. Like, it might notice you moved from a stage of breaking down to a stage of integrating. It helps me understand the patterns."

**If they want specifics**: "I can share insights that would be useful for you to know. Want me to bring some observations next time?"

---

## You're Ready When...

- [ ] You can explain MAIA in 2-3 minutes
- [ ] You have consent forms printed
- [ ] Your recording method works
- [ ] You've practiced your intro script
- [ ] You know which clients to start with
- [ ] You feel 7/10 confident (perfect is the enemy of done)

---

## Final Pep Talk

**You don't need to be perfect tomorrow.**

You're testing. You're learning. You're co-creating.

If you stumble over your words → That's human.
If a client says no → That's data.
If the tech glitches → That's feedback.

**All of it is valuable.**

The goal tomorrow isn't perfection. The goal is **starting**.

Introduce MAIA to 1-2 clients. See what happens. Learn.

Everything else can be refined as you go.

---

**Tonight's Homework** (3 hours):

✅ Hour 1: Decisions (which clients, which method)
✅ Hour 2: Materials (script, consent, tracking)
✅ Hour 3: Setup & rehearsal (tech, practice)

**Tomorrow's Goal**:

✅ Introduce MAIA to at least 1 client
✅ Get at least 1 consent (yes or no, both are wins)
✅ Learn something

**You've got this.** 🚀
