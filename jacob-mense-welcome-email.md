2. Sign up with your email
3. Spend 2-3 minutes setting your preferences
4. Start your first conversation with your Oracle

**What to Expect:**
- 15-20 minutes daily (flexible timing)
- Personalized guidance that adapts to you
- Voice or text conversations
- Private, encrypted interactions
- Real beta testing (we're building this together)

**Your Feedback Matters:**
This is genuine beta - MAIA will surprise you, occasionally stumble, and definitely need your honest feedback to become what it's meant to be. Your experience helps shape the platform.

**Questions?**
Just reply to this email. I'm here to help you get started and want to hear about your experience.

Welcome to something different.

**P.S.** There's no "right way" to use MAIA. The platform meets you exactly where you are. Some people journal with her daily, others check in weekly. Find your rhythm.
