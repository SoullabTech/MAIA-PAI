## Philosophy

> "Your chart is not a sentence—it is a portal."

Spiralogic Astrology transforms astrology from a tool of insight into an immersive, experiential practice that activates consciousness. By integrating Inner Guide journeywork, Jungian active imagination, and the recognition of astrology as a dynamic playground of archetypal forces, we see our charts as living landscapes rather than static maps.

This library contains the archetypal vocabulary that makes that transformation possible.
