## The Three-Stage Progression

Each element moves through three stages:

1. **Vector (Intelligence)**: Cardinal - Initiating, beginning, first contact
2. **Circle (Intention)**: Fixed - Sustaining, stabilizing, deepening
3. **Spiral (Goal)**: Mutable - Adapting, integrating, completing

This creates the **12-facet system** that maps to the 12 astrological houses.

## McGilchrist's Divided Brain Correlation

**Right Prefrontal Cortex (Fire)**: Vision, future projection, creative possibility
**Right Hemisphere (Water)**: Emotional depth, intuition, holistic perception
**Left Hemisphere (Earth)**: Linear thinking, structure, analytical processing

The elements are not just symbolic - they correspond to **actual neurological processes** that shape how we perceive and interact with reality.

## The Unified Field

The genius of Spiralogic is that it shows how:
- **Astrology** (signs, houses, planets)
- **Psychology** (Jung, Erikson, Maslow, etc.)
- **Mythology** (Hero's Journey, archetypes)
- **Neuroscience** (McGilchrist's divided brain)
- **Development** (life stages, team dynamics)
- **Culture** (learning styles, temperaments)

...are all describing the **same elemental patterns** of human consciousness and evolution.
