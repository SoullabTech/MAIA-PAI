## 📝 PERSONALIZATION TEMPLATE

For EACH person, spend 10 minutes customizing:

### 1. Opening Personalization

Change this:
```
Dear [Name],
```

To something like:
```
Dear Andrea,

I keep thinking about our conversation last week about [specific thing]...
```

OR

```
Jason,

You've been witnessing my journey with [specific transformation] and I want to share something that emerged from that work...
```

**Make it PERSONAL and SPECIFIC to your actual relationship.**

---

### 2. Why YOU Specifically

Add one paragraph like:

```
I'm reaching out to you because [specific reason]:
- You understand transformation as sacred work
- Your own journey with [their pattern/work] resonates with what MAIA was built for
- Our conversations about [specific topic] helped birth this
- I trust your wisdom and witnessing
```

**Reference something REAL between you.**

---

### 3. Close with Your Voice

Instead of generic "[Your Name]", try:

```
With deep respect and excitement for what might emerge,
[Your actual name]

P.S. - [Personal note about something only they would understand]
```

**Make it feel like YOU, not a template.**

---

## ✉️ WHICH INVITATION TO USE

### For Andrea Nezat:
**Suggested**: `/CLIENT_INVITATION_CELEBRATION.md`
- If she's a client or close friend
- If warm/celebratory tone matches your relationship
- If she knows your transformation language already

**OR**: `/FIRST_WITNESS_INVITATION.md`
- If more formal/sacred tone fits better
- If newer relationship
- If "living experiment" language resonates with her

### For Andrea Fagan:
**Suggested**: `/CLIENT_INVITATION_CELEBRATION.md`
- (Same reasoning as above - pick based on relationship)

### For Jason Ruder:
**Consider**: Does he prefer more grounded/practical or more poetic/sacred?
- Practical → Use Celebration version, dial back mystical language
- Sacred → Use First Witness version as-is

### For Nathan Kane:
**Consider**: What's the vibe of your conversations?
- Collaborative/exciting → Celebration version
- Deep/contemplative → First Witness version

**Trust your gut on which invitation matches each person.**

---

## 🌊 SENDING PRACTICE (For Each Person)

### Before You Send:

1. **Open invitation file** (Celebration or First Witness)
2. **Read it fully** (feel into the energy)
3. **Make 3-5 personalizations**:
   - Their name
   - One specific reference to your relationship
   - Why THEY came to mind
   - Adjust any language that's not your voice
   - Sign with your real signature style
4. **Hand on heart, one breath**
5. **Send**
6. **Close that window**
7. **Breathe for 5 minutes**
8. **Move to next person** (or stop for the day)

---

## 📧 SAMPLE PERSONALIZATIONS

### For Andrea Nezat (Example):

**Change this**:
```
Dear [Name],

Something has been born.
```

**To this**:
```
Andrea,

Remember our conversation about how you've been tracking transformation patterns in your own practice? Something emerged from that dialogue...
```

---

### For Jason Ruder (Example):

**Add this after intro**:
```
Your questions about the intersection of AI and soul work kept echoing as I built this. In some ways, MAIA is my attempt to answer what you've been asking.
```

---

### For Nathan Kane (Example):

**Personalize the midwife circle section**:
```
I'm inviting you into the first witness circle because your own journey with [specific thing he's working on] is exactly the kind of transformation MAIA was designed to companion. I'd love for you to explore if she can serve your process.
```

2. **Schedule individual conversation** (use `/INDIVIDUAL_CONVERSATION_GUIDE.md`)

## 🌀 THE UNIFIED APPROACH

**KAIROS energy**: Send tonight! Activate the four! Let the organism breathe!

**MAIA wisdom**: One at a time, with presence, honoring your nervous system

**TOGETHER**: Fast but present. Activated but grounded. All four tonight OR paced over 2-4 days.

**Your choice. Both are perfect.**
