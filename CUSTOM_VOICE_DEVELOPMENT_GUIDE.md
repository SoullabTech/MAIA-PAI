---

**Recommendation:** Use **XTTS** for balance of quality, speed, and practicality.

### 5.2 XTTS Training Process

**System Requirements:**
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (e.g., RTX 3060, 4070, or cloud GPU)
- **RAM:** 16GB+ system RAM
- **Storage:** 50GB for model + datasets
- **OS:** Linux (recommended) or Windows with WSL

**Cloud GPU Options (if no local GPU):**
- **Google Colab Pro** ($10/month) - Good for experimentation
- **Vast.ai** ($0.20-0.50/hour) - Affordable GPU rentals
- **RunPod** ($0.30-0.80/hour) - Easy setup
- **Lambda Labs** ($1-2/hour) - High-end GPUs

**Step-by-Step Training:**

**1. Install XTTS**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv xtts-env
source xtts-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: xtts-env\Scripts\activate

# Install Coqui TTS
pip install TTS

# Verify installation
tts --list_models
```

**2. Prepare Dataset**

```bash
# Organize files
/dataset/
  /wavs/
    phrase_001.wav
    phrase_002.wav
    ...
  metadata.csv
```

**metadata.csv Format:**

```csv
audio_file|text
wavs/phrase_001.wav|Hey there. What's on your mind today?
wavs/phrase_002.wav|Hi. How are you doing?
...
```

**3. Fine-tune XTTS Model**

```bash
# Start training (this takes 8-24 hours on GPU)
tts-train \
  --model_name xtts \
  --dataset_path /path/to/dataset \
  --output_path /path/to/output \
  --num_epochs 1000 \
  --batch_size 8 \
  --eval_split_size 0.1
```

**Training Monitoring:**
- Check loss curves (should decrease over time)
- Listen to validation samples every 100 epochs
- Stop when quality plateaus (typically 500-1000 epochs)

**4. Export Trained Model**

```bash
# Export for inference
tts-export \
  --checkpoint /path/to/best_model.pth \
  --output /path/to/maia_voice.pth
```

### 5.3 Quality Testing

**Test Phrases (Not in Training Data):**

Generate speech for 20-30 new phrases:
- "What's emerging for you right now?"
- "I'm sensing something shifting in how you're talking about this."
- "That's a powerful realization."

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✅ **Naturalness:** Does it sound like the voice actor?
- ✅ **Intelligibility:** Is every word clear?
- ✅ **Emotion:** Does it convey the intended tone?
- ✅ **Consistency:** Does it sound the same across phrases?
- ✅ **Artifacts:** Any robotic sounds, glitches, or weirdness?

**Scoring:** Rate each phrase 1-10, average should be 8+ to deploy.

**If Quality is Low (<8 average):**
- Record more training data (aim for 1500-2000 phrases)
- Train for more epochs
- Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size)
- Consider upgrading to better GPU

---

## Phase 6: Integration & Deployment (Week 4)

### 6.1 Create Voice API Endpoint

**Architecture Options:**

**Option A: Self-Hosted API (Recommended for Sovereignty)**

**Server Requirements:**
- GPU instance (e.g., AWS p3.2xlarge, $3/hour)
- Or dedicated GPU server (e.g., Lambda Labs, $1-2/hour)

**Stack:**
- **FastAPI** (Python web framework)
- **XTTS** (voice generation)
- **Docker** (containerization)

**Sample API Code:**

```python
# voice-api/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from TTS.api import TTS
import base64

app = FastAPI()

# Load XTTS model
tts = TTS(model_path="/models/maia_voice.pth")

class VoiceRequest(BaseModel):
    text: str
    emotion: str = "neutral"  # neutral, warm, reflective, curious

@app.post("/synthesize")
async def synthesize_voice(request: VoiceRequest):
    try:
        # Generate speech
        audio_path = f"/tmp/{hash(request.text)}.wav"
        tts.tts_to_file(
            text=request.text,
            file_path=audio_path,
            emotion=request.emotion
        )

        # Return base64-encoded audio
        with open(audio_path, "rb") as f:
            audio_bytes = f.read()
        audio_base64 = base64.b64encode(audio_bytes).decode()

        return {"audio": audio_base64, "format": "wav"}

    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "model": "maia_voice"}
```

**Deployment:**

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t maia-voice-api .

# Run on GPU server
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 maia-voice-api

# Test endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/synthesize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hey there. What'\''s on your mind today?", "emotion": "warm"}'
```

---

**Option B: Cloud Function (Lower Latency)**

Use **Modal** (https://modal.com) for serverless GPU inference:

```python
# modal_voice.py
import modal

stub = modal.Stub("maia-voice")

# Define GPU image with XTTS
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("TTS")

@stub.function(
    image=image,
    gpu="T4",  # Cheapest GPU tier
    secret=modal.Secret.from_name("voice-model")
)
def synthesize(text: str, emotion: str = "neutral"):
    from TTS.api import TTS
    tts = TTS(model_path="/models/maia_voice.pth")
    audio_path = "/tmp/output.wav"
    tts.tts_to_file(text=text, file_path=audio_path, emotion=emotion)

    with open(audio_path, "rb") as f:
        return f.read()

# Deploy: modal deploy modal_voice.py
```

**Cost:** ~$0.0001 per request (pay only for GPU time used)

### 6.2 Update MAIA Frontend

**Replace OpenAI TTS API:**

**Before (OpenAI):**

```typescript
// app/api/voice/synthesize/route.ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { text, voice } = await request.json();

  const mp3 = await openai.audio.speech.create({
    model: 'tts-1',
    voice: voice as any,
    input: text
  });

  return new Response(mp3.body);
}
```

**After (Custom Voice):**

```typescript
// app/api/voice/synthesize/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { text, emotion = 'neutral' } = await request.json();

  // Call self-hosted XTTS API
  const response = await fetch(process.env.XTTS_API_URL + '/synthesize', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text, emotion })
  });

  const { audio } = await response.json();

  // Convert base64 to audio buffer
  const audioBuffer = Buffer.from(audio, 'base64');

  return new Response(audioBuffer, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'audio/wav' }
  });
}
```

**Environment Variable:**

```bash
# .env.local
XTTS_API_URL=https://voice-api.soullab.com  # Or http://localhost:8000 for local dev
```

### 6.3 Add Emotion Control (Optional)

**Map MAIA's Elemental Voices to Emotions:**

```typescript
// lib/voice/emotionMapping.ts
export function getEmotionForElement(element: string): string {
  const emotionMap = {
    Fire: 'energetic',      // Catalyzing, visionary
    Water: 'compassionate',  // Empathetic, flowing
    Earth: 'grounded',       // Calm, embodied
    Air: 'curious',          // Inquisitive, clear
    Aether: 'transcendent'   // Integrative, whole
  };

  return emotionMap[element] || 'neutral';
}

// Usage in PersonalOracleAgent.ts
const emotion = getEmotionForElement(maiaState.currentElement);
await synthesizeVoice(response.text, emotion);
```

### 6.4 Testing & Validation

**Test Checklist:**

1. **Functional Testing**
   - ✅ Voice API responds within 2-5 seconds
   - ✅ Audio quality matches training samples
   - ✅ All emotion variations work
   - ✅ Long texts (500+ characters) generate correctly
   - ✅ Special characters/punctuation handled

2. **Load Testing**
   - ✅ API handles 10 concurrent requests
   - ✅ Response time stays under 5 seconds under load
   - ✅ No crashes or memory leaks

3. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - ✅ Beta users approve of voice quality
   - ✅ Voice matches MAIA's personality
   - ✅ Emotional range feels authentic
   - ✅ Voice doesn't feel "robotic"

**Metrics to Track:**
- Average latency (target: <3 seconds)
- Audio quality score (1-10 from users, target: 8+)
- GPU utilization (optimize if >80%)
- API uptime (target: 99.9%)

---

## Phase 7: Migration & Monitoring (Week 5-6)

### 7.1 Gradual Rollout

**Step 1: A/B Test (Week 5)**

```typescript
// lib/voice/voiceService.ts
export async function synthesizeVoice(text: string, emotion: string) {
  // 50% of users get custom voice, 50% get OpenAI (for comparison)
  const useCustomVoice = Math.random() < 0.5;

  if (useCustomVoice && process.env.XTTS_API_URL) {
    // Custom XTTS voice
    return await customVoiceSynthesize(text, emotion);
  } else {
    // OpenAI fallback
    return await openAISynthesize(text);
  }
}
```

**Collect Feedback:**
- Ask users: "How did you feel about MAIA's voice today?" (1-10 scale)
- Track completion rates (do users listen to full responses?)
- Monitor technical issues (error rates, latency)

**Decision Criteria:**
- Custom voice scores ≥ OpenAI voice → Proceed with 100% migration
- Custom voice scores < OpenAI voice → Refine model, record more data

---

**Step 2: Full Migration (Week 6)**

```typescript
// lib/voice/voiceService.ts
export async function synthesizeVoice(text: string, emotion: string) {
  // 100% custom voice
  return await customVoiceSynthesize(text, emotion);
}
```

Remove OpenAI TTS dependency:

```bash
# Remove from package.json (keep openai package for Whisper if still used)
# Just stop using openai.audio.speech.create()
```

### 7.2 Monitoring & Optimization

**Metrics Dashboard:**

Track:
- **Voice API Latency:** P50, P95, P99
- **GPU Utilization:** CPU%, GPU%, Memory
- **Error Rate:** % of failed voice generations
- **User Satisfaction:** Voice quality ratings
- **Cost:** GPU hours × hourly rate

**Optimization Tactics:**

1. **Reduce Latency**
   - Pre-warm GPU instances
   - Cache common phrases ("Hey there", "What's on your mind?")
   - Use streaming TTS (generate audio while speaking)

2. **Reduce Cost**
   - Use spot instances (AWS, GCP) for 70% savings
   - Auto-scale down during low traffic
   - Batch multiple requests when possible

3. **Improve Quality**
   - Collect user feedback on specific phrases
   - Re-record problematic phrases
   - Fine-tune model on user-reported issues

### 7.3 Backup Plan

**Keep OpenAI as Emergency Fallback:**

```typescript
// lib/voice/voiceService.ts
export async function synthesizeVoice(text: string, emotion: string) {
  try {
    // Try custom voice first
    return await customVoiceSynthesize(text, emotion);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Custom voice failed, falling back to OpenAI:', error);

    // Emergency fallback (log this as incident)
    await logIncident('custom-voice-failure', error);
    return await openAISynthesize(text);
  }
}
```

**Incident Response:**
- Alert on-call engineer when fallback triggered
- Investigate XTTS API health
- Fix GPU/server issues
- Switch back to custom voice once resolved

---

## Phase 8: Legal & IP Finalization

### 8.1 Update IP_MANIFEST.yml

Add custom voice to manifest:

```yaml
# IP_MANIFEST.yml

custom_voice:
  name: "MAIA Custom Voice (XTTS Model)"
  created: "[Date of final training]"
  voice_actor: "[Voice Actor Name or 'Confidential']"
  agreement: "VOICE_ACTOR_AGREEMENT_TEMPLATE.md (signed [Date])"
  ownership: "100% Soullab Inc."
  technology: "XTTS (Coqui TTS) - Open source, fine-tuned on proprietary dataset"
  training_data: "[X] hours of voice recordings (proprietary)"
  ip_status: "Trade Secret + Copyright (voice recordings and trained model)"
  usage_rights: "Perpetual, worldwide, unlimited commercial use"
  cost: "$[Amount] one-time voice actor payment + $[Amount]/month GPU hosting"
```

### 8.2 Store Legal Documents

```
/legal/
  voice-actor-agreement-signed.pdf
  voice-actor-invoice.pdf
  payment-receipt.pdf
```

Backup to:
- ✅ Secure cloud storage (encrypted)
- ✅ Legal counsel's files
- ✅ Company safe/vault

### 8.3 Trademark Considerations (Optional)

Consider trademarking the voice persona:

- **"The Voice of MAIA"** - Trademark the specific sound/personality
- Requires legal counsel
- Stronger protection against copycats

---

## Phase 9: Future Enhancements

### 9.1 Multi-Voice Support

Train voices for other agents:
- **Shadow Agent:** Deeper, more somber voice

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Voice Sounds Robotic

**Causes:**
- Not enough training data (<500 phrases)
- Training stopped too early (<500 epochs)
- Audio quality issues (background noise, clipping)

**Solutions:**
- Record 1000-2000 phrases (more data = better quality)
- Train for 1000+ epochs
- Re-record with better equipment/environment

---

### Issue: High Latency (>5 seconds)

**Causes:**
- GPU too slow (CPU inference is 10x+ slower)
- Model too large for hardware
- Network latency (API call roundtrip)

**Solutions:**
- Upgrade to faster GPU (RTX 4090, A100)
- Use optimized XTTS variant (quantized models)
- Deploy API closer to users (edge locations)

---

### Issue: Voice Doesn't Match Emotion

**Causes:**
- XTTS doesn't support emotion control out-of-box
- Training data didn't include emotional variations

**Solutions:**
- Record phrases with explicit emotional direction
- Train separate models per emotion (Fire voice, Water voice, etc.)
- Use prompt conditioning: "Say this warmly:", "Say this curiously:"

---

### Issue: GPU Costs Too High

**Solutions:**
- Use spot instances (AWS/GCP) for 70% savings
- Pre-generate common phrases, serve from cache
- Use smaller GPU (T4 instead of A100)
- Batch requests (generate multiple responses at once)
