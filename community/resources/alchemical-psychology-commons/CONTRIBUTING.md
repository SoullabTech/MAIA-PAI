### During Submission

**Pull Request description should include**:
- **Type of contribution**: Case study, protocol, research, etc.
- **Brief summary**: 2-3 sentences describing the contribution

- **Testing/validation**: How has this been tested or verified?
- **Related work**: Links to related Commons content

**Example PR description**:
```markdown
## Type: Clinical Protocol

## Summary
Submitting a protocol for working with Puer-Senex splits in clients oscillating
between inflation (eternal youth) and deflation (premature old age).

## Why it matters
This signature appears frequently in practice but wasn't included in core suite.
Fills a gap in operation-specific protocols.

## Testing
Applied with 8 clients over 14 months. Average coherence increase: +0.22.
Detailed outcomes included in protocol.

## Related work
- Builds on Separatio Protocol
- Complements Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation case study

## Review Process

### What to Expect

**1. Initial Screening** (2-3 days)
- **Moderator review**: Checks for appropriate content, template usage, anonymization
- **Outcome**: Approved for peer review, or feedback for revisions

**2. Peer Review** (1-2 weeks)
- **Two practitioners/researchers** review for:
  - Clinical soundness (for cases/protocols)
  - Theoretical accuracy (Jung-Edinger-Hillman alignment)
  - Practical usefulness (can others apply this?)
  - Ethical compliance
- **Outcome**: Approved, approved with minor revisions, major revisions needed, or declined

**3. Revisions** (if needed)
- Reviewers provide specific feedback
- You make changes and resubmit
- Reviewers confirm revisions address concerns

**4. Publication**
- Approved contributions merged into Commons
- Your name/pseudonym credited
- Community can now access, use, and build on your work

### Review Criteria

**For Case Studies**:
- [ ] Thoroughly anonymized (client unidentifiable)
- [ ] Spiralogic framework applied appropriately
- [ ] Clear progression through transformation
- [ ] Honest about challenges and limitations
- [ ] Useful for other practitioners

**For Clinical Protocols**:
- [ ] Evidence of real-world testing
- [ ] Theoretically grounded in Jung-Edinger-Hillman
- [ ] Clear, actionable steps
- [ ] Safety protocols specified
- [ ] Includes contraindications and risks

**For Research**:
- [ ] Methodology sound
- [ ] Results clearly reported

- [ ] Doesn't break existing features
- [ ] Serves therapeutic goals (not just technical)

### If Your Contribution is Declined

We know rejection is hard, especially in this field. Here's why we might decline:

- **Not ready yet**: Needs more development, testing, or detail → Revise and resubmit
- **Out of scope**: Doesn't align with Jung-Edinger-Hillman framework → Consider submitting to different venue
- **Ethical concerns**: Confidentiality, safety, or consent issues → Cannot publish until resolved
- **Duplication**: Content already well-covered in Commons → Could you enhance existing work instead?
- **Quality standards**: Below minimum threshold → Invest more time before resubmitting

**You will always receive specific feedback explaining the decision.**
