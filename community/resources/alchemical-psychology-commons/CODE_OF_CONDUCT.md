# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The Alchemical Psychology Commons is dedicated to providing a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment for practitioners, researchers, students, and developers working with depth psychology and transformation.

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to psychological depth, clinical rigor, and ethical practice—while remaining open, curious, and humble about the mysteries we're engaging.

## Specific Ethical Guidelines

### Client Confidentiality

**When sharing case material**:
- Use case template with anonymization checklist
- Change all identifying details (names, locations, occupations, etc.)
- Obtain client consent if required by your jurisdiction
- If in doubt, consult with supervisor or ethics board
- Remember: client cannot recognize themselves in your write-up

**Red lines** (never acceptable):
- Sharing real names or identifying photos
- Publishing without proper anonymization
- Using cases to shame or expose clients
- Sharing current clients' material without consent

### Scope of Practice

**Work within your training**:
- Don't provide interventions you're not trained in
- Acknowledge when you're out of your depth
- Refer to appropriate professionals when needed
- Don't claim credentials you don't have

**When contributing**:
- Clearly state your credentials and training
- Acknowledge limitations of your expertise
- Don't provide medical/psychiatric advice if you're not qualified
- Mark speculative ideas as such

### Safety First

**Framework NEVER overrides safety**:
- If client is suicidal, safety protocol takes precedence over transformation work
- If you're uncertain, consult with supervisor or emergency services
- Coherence metrics are guides, not gospel—trust your clinical judgment
- When in doubt, prioritize immediate safety over long-term transformation

**In community spaces**:
- Report concerning content (posts suggesting self-harm, severe crisis, etc.)
- Don't provide emergency intervention via GitHub (direct to crisis services)
- Remember Commons is educational, not clinical treatment

### Feedback Culture

**When giving feedback**:
- Be specific and constructive
- Separate the work from the person
- Acknowledge what's working before suggesting changes
- Consider the psychological impact of your words
- Remember: we're all vulnerable when sharing our work

**When receiving feedback**:
- Assume reviewers are trying to be helpful
- Ask for clarification if feedback is unclear
- You can disagree with feedback (and explain why)
- Thank reviewers even if you don't implement all suggestions
- Recognize feedback as contribution to your growth

### Power Dynamics

**Acknowledge power differences**:
- Senior practitioners: mentor generously, don't gatekeep
- Junior practitioners: your perspective is valuable—contribute confidently
- Researchers: make work accessible, not just academic
- Developers: serve therapeutic goals, not just technical elegance

**Avoid**:
- Using seniority to dismiss new perspectives
- Exploiting junior contributors' labor without credit
- Creating in-groups and out-groups
- Weaponizing credentials in disagreements

## Cultural & Philosophical Values

### Hillman's Ethics

James Hillman warned against "instrumentalizing" the psyche—treating soul as a problem to be solved. We commit to:

- **Witnessing** transformation, not engineering it
- **Respecting** psyche's autonomy and timing
- **Honoring** symptoms as meaningful, not just obstacles
- **Valuing** depth and multiplicity over optimization
- **Remembering** anima mundi—psyche is in the world, not just individual

### Jung's Humility

Jung knew he was engaging mysteries beyond complete comprehension. We commit to:

- **Epistemic humility**: Acknowledging what we don't know
- **Respect for the unconscious**: Not presuming to fully control or understand
- **Honoring paradox**: Both/and thinking, not just either/or
- **Personal work**: You can't guide others where you haven't been

### Edinger's Precision

Edinger mapped alchemical operations with surgical precision. We commit to:

- **Conceptual clarity**: Define terms, use language precisely
- **Clinical rigor**: Test hypotheses, track outcomes, report honestly
- **Systematic thinking**: Build coherent frameworks
- **Practical application**: Theory must serve real people

## Our Commitment

We commit to enforcing this Code of Conduct fairly and consistently. We commit to creating a space where:

- Practitioners can share vulnerable clinical material safely
- Researchers can explore cutting-edge questions rigorously
- Students can learn without intimidation
- Developers can contribute meaningfully
- Everyone can engage the depths with respect and wonder

The work we're doing here—integrating Jung, Edinger, and Hillman into computational alchemy—requires both precision and soul. May this Code of Conduct help us maintain both.
