## Spiralogic Assessment

### Initial Analysis (Session 1-2)

**Estimated Coherence**: [0.00-1.00]

**Stage Assessment**: [ ] Nigredo [ ] Albedo [ ] Citrinitas [ ] Rubedo

**Operations Detected** (check all that apply):
- [ ] Calcinatio (ego burning)
- [ ] Solutio (dissolution)
- [ ] Coagulatio (structure formation)
- [ ] Sublimatio (rising to vision)
- [ ] Mortificatio (identity death)
- [ ] Separatio (differentiation)
- [ ] Coniunctio (integration)
- [ ] Fermentatio (inspiration)
- [ ] Distillatio (refinement)
- [ ] Multiplicatio (spiral continues)

**Primary Operation(s)**:
[1-2 most active operations with brief explanation of evidence]

**Transformation Signature**:
[e.g., "Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation - swinging between breakdown and grandiose vision"]

**Polyvagal State**:
- Ventral (social engagement): [Low/Medium/High]
- Sympathetic (fight/flight): [Low/Medium/High]
- Dorsal (shutdown): [Low/Medium/High]
- Overall safety: [0.00-1.00]

**Framework Effectiveness** (which resonates most):
1. [e.g., Polyvagal - 0.80]
2. [e.g., IFS - 0.65]
3. [e.g., Jungian - 0.50]

**Awareness Level**: [ ] Beginner [ ] Familiar [ ] Intermediate [ ] Advanced [ ] Master

## Treatment Approach

### Clinical Hypothesis
[1-2 paragraphs: What is happening psychologically? What needs to transform? What's trying to emerge?]

### Protocol(s) Applied
**Primary Protocol**: [e.g., Solutio Protocol]

**Rationale**: [Why this protocol?]

**Adaptations**: [How did you modify for this client?]

**Language Adaptation**: [How did you explain framework to client given their awareness level?]

---

## Journey

### Phase 1: [Timeframe, e.g., Sessions 1-4, Weeks 1-6]

**Stage**: [Nigredo/Albedo/Citrinitas/Rubedo]
**Coherence**: [Estimate]
**Active Operations**: [List]

**Key moments**:
- [Session X]: [What happened, breakthrough/challenge]
- [Session Y]: [What happened]

**Client quote** (optional):
> "[Illustrative quote from this phase]"

**Your reflection**:
[What you noticed, what you were tracking, clinical decisions]

### Phase 2: [Timeframe]

[Same structure as Phase 1]

### Phase 3: [Timeframe]

[Same structure as Phase 1]

## Outcomes

### Final Assessment

**Coherence**: [Initial] → [Final] (Change: +/- [amount])

**Stage**: [Initial] → [Final]

**Operations**: [How did they shift?]

**Polyvagal**: [Initial safety] → [Final safety]

### Measurable Changes
- [Symptom measures if used, e.g., PHQ-9: 18 → 8]
- [Functioning improvements]
- [Subjective wellbeing]

### Client's Words
> "[Quote from client about their experience of transformation]"

### Your Assessment
**What transformed**:
[1-2 paragraphs on what actually changed, not just symptom reduction]

**What supported transformation**:
[What interventions, insights, or relationship factors were most helpful]

**Spiralogic framework effectiveness**:
[How well did framework guide treatment? What worked? What didn't?]
