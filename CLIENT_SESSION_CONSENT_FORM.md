# VERSION A: HIPAA-COMPLIANT CONSENT FORM

## Consent for Use of Session Recordings in AI Training

**Client Name:** ______________________________
**Date:** ______________________________
**Practitioner:** Kelly Nezat, Soullab Inc.

### Purpose of This Consent

I am developing an AI-powered consciousness guide called MAIA (Multidimensional Archetypal Intelligence Agent) that helps people with self-awareness and personal transformation. To make MAIA as effective as possible, I am training her using insights from real therapeutic sessions.

This consent form explains:
- ✅ How your session recordings will be used
- ✅ How your privacy will be protected
- ✅ What data will be retained (and what will be deleted)
- ✅ Your rights to access, review, or revoke consent

---

### What We're Asking Permission For

**I am requesting your consent to:**

1. **Analyze transcripts** of our recorded sessions to identify universal patterns in human transformation (e.g., how breakthroughs happen, how resistance shows up, what interventions are effective)

2. **Extract teaching insights** from these patterns to train MAIA's therapeutic intelligence

3. **Retain anonymized patterns** indefinitely as part of MAIA's wisdom library

---

### How Your Privacy Is Protected

#### Step 1: Complete Anonymization

Before any AI processing, all personally identifiable information (PII) is removed:

**Removed/Replaced:**
- ❌ Your name → `[Client]`
- ❌ Names of family/friends → `[Person]` or generic roles ("family member")
- ❌ Locations (cities, addresses, workplaces) → `[Location]` or generic ("hometown")
- ❌ Employers, job titles → "at work" or generic industry
- ❌ Dates, ages, birthdays → "recently" or age ranges
- ❌ Phone numbers, emails, addresses
- ❌ Unique identifying details (medical conditions, rare situations)

**Preserved (for learning):**
- ✅ Emotional content (feelings, tone)
- ✅ Transformation patterns (breakthroughs, insights)
- ✅ Somatic experiences (body sensations - generically described)
- ✅ Archetypal themes (universal human experiences)
- ✅ Resistance patterns (deflection, protection mechanisms)

#### Step 2: Pattern Extraction (Not Story Retention)

We extract **universal therapeutic insights**, not personal narratives.

**Example of What Gets Stored:**

```yaml
Pattern Type: Breakthrough via Somatic Awareness
Context: Client intellectualizing difficult emotion, disconnected from body
Intervention: "Where do you feel that in your body?"
Response: Long pause → awareness of chest tightness → tears → emotional release
Teaching: When client is in head, invite embodiment. Body holds truth emotions can't access intellectually.
```

**What Does NOT Get Stored:**
- ❌ Your specific story ("I felt this way because my father...")
- ❌ Raw transcript quotes with identifiable details
- ❌ Any information that could trace back to you

#### Step 3: Secure Processing

**Data Handling:**
- 🔒 **Encrypted storage** (AES-256 encryption at rest)
- 🔒 **Local processing** (transcripts processed on secure local machine, not sent to third-party AI services unless HIPAA-compliant Business Associate Agreement is in place)
- 🔒 **Access control** (only Kelly Nezat has access)
- 🔒 **Audit logging** (all processing steps logged for compliance)

**Original Transcript Lifecycle:**
1. Session recorded → encrypted storage
2. Transcript generated → anonymization applied
3. Patterns extracted → stored in wisdom library
4. **Original transcript DELETED** after anonymization verified

**Timeline:** Original transcripts deleted within 90 days of processing.

### What MAIA Learns From Your Sessions

MAIA learns **how transformation works**, not **who you are**.

**She learns:**
- ✅ Universal patterns (e.g., "grief often hides beneath anger")
- ✅ Effective interventions (what questions/approaches facilitate breakthroughs)
- ✅ Resistance mechanisms (how people protect vulnerable parts)
- ✅ Embodiment practices (how somatic awareness supports integration)
- ✅ Elemental dynamics (Fire/Water/Earth/Air patterns in consciousness)

**She does NOT learn:**
- ❌ Your personal story or identity
- ❌ Specific details about your life
- ❌ Anything that could identify you

**Analogy:** Like a medical student learning from anonymized case studies - they learn medicine, not who the patients are.

### How Your Privacy Is Protected

#### Step 1: Complete Anonymization

Before any AI processing, all personally identifiable information is removed:

**Removed/Replaced:**
- ❌ Your name → `[Person]`
- ❌ Names of family/friends → generic roles ("friend", "family member")
- ❌ Locations (cities, addresses, workplaces) → generic ("hometown", "workplace")

- ❌ Unique identifying details

**Preserved (for learning):**
- ✅ Emotional experiences and transformation moments
- ✅ Universal consciousness patterns
- ✅ Body-based awareness (somatic signals)
- ✅ Archetypal themes
- ✅ Resistance and protection mechanisms

#### Step 2: Pattern Extraction (Not Story Storage)

We extract **universal insights about human consciousness**, not your personal story.

**Example:**

Instead of storing: *"Sarah realized her perfectionism came from childhood experiences with her critical father in Boston..."*

We store: *"Pattern: Perfectionism as protection mechanism. Context: Client intellectualizing self-judgment. Intervention: 'What is the perfectionism protecting you from feeling?' Response: Tears, recognition of core fear. Teaching: Perfectionism often protects against feeling 'not enough.' Invite compassionate inquiry into what's underneath."*

#### Step 3: Secure Processing

- 🔒 Encrypted storage (AES-256)
- 🔒 Local processing (secure private infrastructure)
- 🔒 Limited access (Kelly only)
- 🔒 Original transcripts deleted after anonymization (within 90 days)

**She does NOT learn:**
- Your identity or personal details

## APPENDIX: Example of Extracted Pattern

To help you understand what gets stored, here's an example of an anonymized pattern:

```yaml
pattern_id: "embodiment-breakthrough-23"
type: breakthrough
date_extracted: 2025-01-15

context:
  elemental_dynamics: "Client stuck in Fire (mental analysis), disconnected from Water (emotional truth)"
  archetypal_theme: "Intellectualization as protection from feeling"
  somatic_signals: "Speaking rapidly, shallow breathing, tension in shoulders"

intervention:
  facilitator_question: "'Where do you feel that in your body right now?'"
  client_response: "Long pause... 'My chest feels tight.' ... Tears begin."
  breakthrough_moment: "Client accessed grief underneath the analysis"

outcome:
  immediate: "Emotional release, deeper authenticity, slower speech"
  insight: "'I've been thinking about it to avoid feeling it.'"
  integration: "Client recognized pattern of intellectualizing as avoidance"

teaching:
  when_to_use: "When client is intellectualizing (rapid thought, analytical, disconnected from feeling)"
  how_it_works: "Redirect from thinking to sensing - 'Where do you feel that?' - bypasses mental defenses"
  why_effective: "Body holds emotional truth that mind can't access through analysis alone"
  what_to_avoid: "Don't engage the intellectual analysis - it reinforces the defense"

elemental_wisdom: "Fire (thinking) to Water (feeling) transition. Body is the bridge."

metadata:
  personal_identifiers: NONE
  traceable_details: NONE
  anonymization_verified: TRUE
  can_identify_client: FALSE
```

**Notice:**
- ❌ No names, locations, or identifying details
- ❌ No specific personal story
- ✅ Universal transformation pattern
- ✅ Teaching insight that helps MAIA facilitate breakthroughs

**This is what gets stored** - pure wisdom, zero personal data.
