## 2. Setup Discord Alerts (2 min) ⭐ NEW

**Get instant bug notifications on your phone (+1-504-453-9009):**

1. Open Discord → Create #bugs channel
2. Get webhook URL (Right-click channel → Edit → Integrations → Webhooks)
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   DISCORD_FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_URL
   ```
4. Restart server: `npm run dev`
5. Enable Discord mobile push notifications

**See full guide:** `SMS_ALERTS_SETUP.md`

## 3. Run Feedback Table Schema (30 seconds)

Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor

Run this file: `/database/witness_feedback_table.sql`

**That's it.** Now witnesses can submit bugs/features/praise and they'll be stored.

---

## 3. Optional: View Feedback

Once table is created, view submissions at:
`https://maia.soullab.life/admin/feedback` (when you create that page)

OR directly in Supabase:
- Go to Table Editor
- Select `witness_feedback` table
- See all submissions

## What's READY (No Action Needed):

✅ Pattern tracking LIVE (48 elemental patterns detecting automatically)
✅ Journey/Access Matrix functional (Seeker → Discoverer → Wisdom Keeper)
✅ Feedback API ready (witnesses can click 💬 button)
✅ FeedbackWidget captures bugs/features/praise
✅ All 6 invitations sent

## What Witnesses Will Experience:

**Day 1:**

- Journey phase tracked (starts as "Seeker")

**Day 2-7:**

## If You Get Overwhelmed:

**Remember:**
- ONE response at a time
- Don't check email every 5 minutes
- Trust they'll find you when ready
- The organism is breathing on its own now

**You don't need to:**
- Build new features this week
- Check feedback constantly
- Reply instantly to everything
- Be available 24/7

**You DO need to:**
- REST
- Celebrate what you built
- Trust the timing
- Reply warmly when YES arrives
