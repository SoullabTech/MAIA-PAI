# Practitioner Guide: Using MAIA with the Jung-Edinger-Hillman Framework

*A handbook for therapists, coaches, and transformation practitioners*

---

## Introduction: Intelligence in Service of Soul

This guide provides **practical protocols** for using MAIA's intelligence engine in your clinical, coaching, or transformation work. It assumes you've read the main paper (*"The Spiralogic of Soul"*) and are familiar with:

- Jung's alchemical stages (Nigredo → Albedo → Citrinitas → Rubedo)
- Edinger's 12 operations (*Calcinatio, Solutio, Coagulatio*, etc.)
- Hillman's *anima mundi* (world-soul) and depathologizing stance
- Spiralogic's geometry and coherence tracking

**This guide answers**:
1. How do I integrate MAIA into my existing practice?
2. How do I read the intelligence dashboard?
3. What interventions match which stages/operations?
4. How do I avoid instrumentalizing transformation?
5. What are the ethical considerations?

---

## Part 1: Getting Started with MAIA

### 1.1 Setting Up Intelligence Tracking

**Initial Assessment** (First Session):

```typescript
// What MAIA captures automatically:
{
  conversationHistory: [], // All sessions stored
  awarenessBaseline: "beginner" | "familiar" | "intermediate" | "advanced" | "master",
  frameworkExposure: {
    jung: false,
    ifs: false,
    polyvagal: false,
    // ... etc
  },
  initialCoherence: 0.00 - 1.00 // Baseline measurement
}
```

**Your role as practitioner**:
- Have initial conversation about user's presenting concerns
- Let MAIA listen (it's analyzing in background)
- After session, review MAIA's intelligence report
- Use report to inform (not dictate) your clinical judgment

### 1.2 Understanding the Intelligence Dashboard

When you open a client's dashboard, you'll see:

```

║  AWARENESS LEVEL: Intermediate (62/100)      ║
║                                               ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**How to read it**:

1. **Coherence (top number)**: Overall integration level
   - < 0.30 = Crisis support mode
   - 0.30-0.50 = Gentle clarification
   - 0.50-0.75 = Active integration work
   - > 0.75 = Embodiment/wisdom phase

2. **Stage**: Jung's alchemical phase
   - Tells you *what kind of work* is appropriate
   - Don't force Rubedo (embodiment) when they're in Nigredo (dissolution)

3. **Operations**: Edinger's specific transformations active
   - Tells you *which specific intervention* to use
   - See Section 2 for operation-specific protocols

4. **Active Signatures**: Recurring patterns MAIA detected
   - High confidence (>80%) = well-established pattern
   - Moderate (60-80%) = emerging or weakening pattern
   - Low (<60%) = possible but not confirmed

5. **Framework Effectiveness**: What actually works for this person
   - Use frameworks ranked highest
   - Don't force your favorite framework if it's low-ranked for them

6. **Awareness Level**: How to speak to them
   - Beginner = NO jargon, lived metaphors only
   - Master = Full technical precision appropriate

### 1.3 Your First Week with MAIA

**Day 1-2**: Observation mode
- Let MAIA analyze without intervening
- Get baseline coherence
- See what signatures emerge

**Day 3-4**: Calibration
- Compare MAIA's assessment with your clinical intuition
- Where do they agree? Where do they diverge?
- Trust discrepancies — they're worth exploring

**Day 5-7**: Integration
- Begin using MAIA's framework effectiveness rankings
- Try language adaptation (match their awareness level)
- Test one operation-specific intervention (see Section 2)

**Week 2+**: Full integration
- MAIA becomes your "second opinion" colleague
- You provide human presence, MAIA provides pattern recognition
- Together you serve the client's transformation

---

## Part 2: Operation-Specific Intervention Protocols

Each of Edinger's 12 operations requires different approaches. Here's your clinical guide:

### 2.1 Calcinatio (Fire - Ego Burning)

**When MAIA detects Calcinatio**:
- User shows: Burnout, inflation, grandiosity followed by crash
- Coherence often: Dropping (0.60 → 0.45)
- Stage: Often Nigredo or early Albedo

**What's happening**:
The psyche is burning off ego inflation. This can feel like:
- "I thought I was special, now I feel like nothing"
- "I pushed too hard, now I'm exhausted"
- "My identity is crumbling"

**Your intervention**:

✅ **DO**:
- Validate the burn: "Something inflated needed to be burned away"
- Explore: "What were you identified with that's dying now?"
- Normalize: "Calcinatio feels like failure, but it's purification"
- Introduce cooling practices (water element) to balance fire

❌ **DON'T**:
- Rush to rebuild ego ("Let's work on self-esteem!")
- Pathologize ("This is just low self-worth")
- Bypass the burn ("Think positive thoughts!")

**Awareness-adapted language**:

| Level | Language |
|-------|----------|
| Beginner | "Something you were attached to is being burned away. It hurts, but it's making space for something real." |
| Intermediate | "You're going through what's called *calcinatio* — the burning phase. Your ego's false inflation is being purified through fire." |
| Advanced | "*Calcinatio* active, coherence dropping as expected. Ego-Self axis recalibrating. Don't prematurely reconstruct — let the burn complete." |
| Master | "*Calcinatio* at 85% confidence. Coherence 0.45 descending. Sulfur volatilizing. Support *mortificatio* (death) before *coagulatio* (rebuilding). Typical duration: 4-8 weeks this octave." |

### 2.2 Solutio (Water - Dissolution)

**When MAIA detects Solutio**:
- User shows: Emotional flooding, boundaries dissolving, "everything feels formless"
- Coherence: Often stable or slightly dropping
- Stage: Nigredo or Albedo

**What's happening**:
Rigid structures (mental, emotional, relational) are dissolving. This is necessary before new form can emerge.

**Your intervention**:

✅ **DO**:
- Hold container: "I'm here as a solid presence while you're liquid"
- Validate dissolution: "Formlessness is part of the process"
- Introduce gentle structure (but not rigidity)
- Ask: "What's dissolving? What needs to dissolve?"

❌ **DON'T**:
- Prematurely coagulate ("Let's create a structure right now!")
- Pathologize ("You're being too emotional")
- Leave them drowning (some container is needed)

**Practices**:
- Journaling (liquid thoughts onto solid page)
- Body-based grounding (earth element to balance water)
- Titrated processing (not endless flooding)

### 2.3 Coagulatio (Earth - Forming Structure)

**When MAIA detects Coagulatio**:
- User shows: Things starting to "land," new patterns forming
- Coherence: Often rising
- Stage: Albedo or Citrinitas

**What's happening**:
After dissolution (*solutio*), new structure is crystallizing. This is delicate—too much pressure breaks it, too little and it doesn't solidify.

**Your intervention**:

✅ **DO**:
- Support structure-building (daily practices, routines, boundaries)
- Ask: "What wants to take form now?"
- Celebrate small structures (don't demand grand vision yet)
- Ground insights into body/action

❌ **DON'T**:
- Force coagulation before dissolution is complete
- Demand perfection ("This structure must be final!")
- Skip coagulation (rushing to next fire/vision)

**Awareness-adapted**:
- Beginner: "Things are starting to take shape. Let's build something small and solid."
- Master: "*Coagulatio* at 72% confidence. Salt (body) crystallizing from Mercury (spirit). Support embodiment practices. Check: Is this premature solidification or genuine integration?"

### 2.4 Sublimatio (Air - Rising to Vision)

**When MAIA detects Sublimatio**:
- User shows: New perspective, seeing from higher vantage, "aha" moments
- Coherence: Often rising
- Stage: Albedo or Citrinitas

**What's happening**:
Consciousness is rising from immersion in matter/emotion to symbolic perspective. This is healthy transcendence (not spiritual bypass).

**Your intervention**:

✅ **DO**:
- Validate the vision: "Something is clarifying"
- Ground it: "How does this insight live in your body?"
- Test it: "Is this genuine *sublimatio* or ego inflation?"
- Connect to previous operations: "You dissolved (*solutio*), you formed (*coagulatio*), now you're seeing the pattern (*sublimatio*)"

❌ **DON'T**:
- Let them stay only in vision (needs grounding)
- Confuse sublimatio with spiritual bypass
- Dismiss the insight as "just mental"

### 2.5 Mortificatio (Water/Shadow - Death)

**When MAIA detects Mortificatio**:
- User shows: Something dying, grief, letting go, "I don't know who I am anymore"
- Coherence: Often dropping (but this is healthy)
- Stage: Nigredo

**What's happening**:
An old identity, attachment, or way of being is dying. This is necessary death, not pathological depression.

**Your intervention** (CRITICAL):

✅ **DO**:
- Witness the death: "Something is dying. Let it die."
- Differentiate: "Is this death-as-transformation or death-as-suicide?" (Assess safety if unclear)
- Hold space: "I'm here while you grieve what's ending"
- Honor the dead: "What did that version of you do for you? What gift did it give?"

❌ **DON'T**:
- Rush resurrection ("Let's create a new you!")
- Pathologize ("This is major depressive episode")
- Abandon them (death needs witness)
- Force meaning-making prematurely

**When Mortificatio goes too far**:
- Coherence < 0.20 = Emergency support mode
- Distinguish *mortificatio* (death-as-transformation) from suicidality (death-as-escape)
- If suicidal ideation present: CLINICAL SAFETY PROTOCOL overrides alchemical framework

### 2.6 Separatio (Air - Discrimination)

**When MAIA detects Separatio**:
- User shows: "This is mine, that's not mine," boundaries forming, discernment emerging
- Coherence: Stable or rising
- Stage: Albedo or Citrinitas

**What's happening**:
Differentiating opposites that were fused. Examples:
- Self vs. parts (IFS)
- Personal vs. collective (Hillman)
- Inflation vs. genuine insight
- My shadow vs. other's shadow (projection withdrawal)

**Your intervention**:

✅ **DO**:
- Support discrimination: "What's yours? What's theirs? What's the world's?"
- Use IFS: "Is this part talking, or is this Self?"
- Explore projections: "What do you see in them that might be your shadow?"
- Validate complexity: "Both can be true. You don't have to collapse it into one."

❌ **DON'T**:
- Force premature unity ("But we're all one!")
- Pathologize healthy boundaries ("You're being too rigid")
- Skip separatio and rush to coniunctio (union needs prior differentiation)

### 2.7 Coniunctio (Aether - Union of Opposites)

**When MAIA detects Coniunctio**:
- User shows: "I can hold both," paradox accepted, opposites integrated
- Coherence: Rising significantly
- Stage: Citrinitas or Rubedo

**What's happening**:
The sacred marriage. Opposites unite not by collapsing but by dancing. Examples:
- Fire AND earth (vision AND structure)
- Masculine AND feminine
- Light AND shadow
- Personal AND political (Hillman)

**Your intervention**:

✅ **DO**:
- Celebrate: "You're holding the paradox. This is *coniunctio*."
- Stabilize: "How do you embody this union? Not just understand it?"
- Test: "Is this genuine integration or false peace?"
- Name the third: "What emerges from the union that's neither/both?"

❌ **DON'T**:
- Force coniunctio before separatio complete
- Confuse coniunctio with:
  - Compromise (neither/nor)
  - Dissociation (both split)
  - Spiritual bypass (pretend union)

**Awareness-adapted**:
- Beginner: "You're learning to hold two things that seemed opposite. They can both be true."
- Master: "*Coniunctio* at 88% confidence. Coherence spike 0.52 → 0.68. Hieros gamos (sacred marriage) active. Track: Does union remain in body or collapse to head? Support grounding."

### 2.8 Fermentatio (Fire - Spirit Entering Matter)

**When MAIA detects Fermentatio**:
- User shows: Inspiration, creative fire, new energy after death phase
- Coherence: Rising after prior drop
- Stage: Citrinitas or Rubedo

**What's happening**:
After *mortificatio* (death), spirit returns. Like yeast fermenting dough—something dead becomes alive.

**Your intervention**:

✅ **DO**:
- Validate new energy: "Something is coming alive"
- Ground it: "How does this inspiration want to live in form?"
- Channel it: "What's this creative fire for?"

❌ **DON'T**:
- Confuse fermentatio with manic energy (check coherence—is it integrated?)
- Let it stay only spiritual (needs incarnation)

### 2.9 Distillatio (Water - Purification)

**When MAIA detects Distillatio**:
- User shows: Refining, distilling essence from experience
- Coherence: Stable or rising
- Stage: Citrinitas

**Your intervention**:

✅ **DO**:
- Ask: "What's the essence here? What distills from all that happened?"
- Support reflection (not rumination)
- Help extract wisdom from suffering

❌ **DON'T**:
- Force meaning-making prematurely
- Confuse distillatio with intellectualization

### 2.10 Second Coagulatio (Earth - New Embodiment)

**When MAIA detects 2nd Coagulatio**:
- User shows: Wisdom becoming lived, not just understood
- Coherence: High (0.70+)
- Stage: Rubedo

**Your intervention**:

✅ **DO**:
- Celebrate embodiment: "This is living in you now, not just known"
- Support integration into daily life
- Prepare for next nigredo (spiral continues)

### 2.11-2.12 Citrinitas/Rubedo & Multiplicatio

See coherence scale (Section 3.1) for detailed intervention protocols at these stages.

---

## Part 3: Stage-Based Clinical Protocols

### 3.1 Nigredo (Coherence < 0.30) - CRISIS PROTOCOL

**Recognition**:
- Coherence drops below 0.30
- User may report: "I can't go on," "Everything's dark," "I'm lost"
- Operations often active: *Mortificatio, Solutio, Calcinatio*

**IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT**:

```
⚠️ SAFETY CHECK ⚠️
Ask directly:
1. "Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself?"
2. "Do you have a plan?"
3. "Do you have means?"

If YES to 2 or 3: CLINICAL SAFETY PROTOCOL
(This overrides alchemical framework)
```

**If physically safe, but in deep Nigredo**:

✅ **DO (Hillman-informed)**:
- **Stay in the black**: "This darkness is not your enemy. It's where soul deepens."
- **Don't pathologize**: "You're not broken. You're in *nigredo* — the necessary dissolution."
- **Witness, don't fix**: "I'm here with you in this. We're not rushing out."
- **Co-regulate** (Polyvagal): Your nervous system lends stability to theirs
- **No insight work**: Not the time for "What does this mean?" Just presence.

❌ **DON'T**:
- Try to "cheer them up"
- Rush to solutions
- Pathologize as "major depression" (unless clinical indicators present)
- Do deep processing work (system too fragmented)

**Hillman principle**: "The cure for nigredo is not albedo (light). The cure is going deeper into nigredo until it transforms itself."

**Duration**: Could be days, weeks, or months. MAIA tracks. Don't rush.

### 3.2 Albedo (Coherence 0.30-0.50) - CLARIFICATION

**Recognition**:
- Coherence 0.30-0.50
- User: "I'm starting to see things more clearly"
- Operations: *Separatio, Sublimatio, Coagulatio*

✅ **DO**:
- Support emerging structure (but gently)
- Help differentiate (separatio): "What's yours? What's not?"
- Introduce framework teaching (they have capacity now)
- Begin IFS unburdening if appropriate

❌ **DON'T**:
- Force premature integration
- Demand they "stay positive"
- Skip this phase (it's necessary clarification)

### 3.3 Citrinitas (Coherence 0.50-0.75) - INTEGRATION

**Recognition**:
- Coherence 0.50-0.75
- User: "Things are coming together," "I'm seeing the pattern"
- Operations: *Coniunctio, Distillatio, Sublimatio*

✅ **DO**:
- Active integration work
- Connect insights to embodiment
- Synthesis across frameworks
- Prepare for Rubedo (embodiment phase)

### 3.4 Rubedo (Coherence > 0.75) - EMBODIMENT

**Recognition**:
- Coherence > 0.75
- User: "This is living in me now," "I'm different"
- Operations: *Fermentatio, 2nd Coagulatio, Multiplicatio*

✅ **DO**:
- Celebrate embodied wisdom
- Support lived practice (not just understanding)
- **Prepare for next nigredo**: "The spiral continues. This wisdom will be tested."
- Help transmit to community (multiplicatio)

---

## Part 4: Ethical Considerations & Limitations

### 4.1 What MAIA Is NOT

❌ **NOT a replacement for clinical judgment**
- You are the practitioner, MAIA is a tool
- Trust your intuition over algorithm if they conflict

❌ **NOT for diagnosis**
- MAIA identifies transformation patterns, not DSM diagnoses
- If psychosis, severe depression, or mania present: Use standard clinical protocols

❌ **NOT infallible**
- Signatures can be wrong (especially at low confidence <60%)
- Coherence is one metric, not the whole picture

❌ **NOT for everyone**
- Some clients don't resonate with alchemical language
- Some need different frameworks entirely
- Some need medical intervention (meds, hospitalization)

### 4.2 When NOT to Use Alchemical Framework

**Use standard clinical protocols if**:
- Active psychosis (needs grounding in consensus reality first)
- Acute suicidality (safety protocol overrides alchemy)
- Severe mania (needs stabilization)
- Active addiction in crisis (needs harm reduction)
- Client explicitly rejects the framework

**You can return to alchemical lens once stabilized.**

### 4.3 Cultural Considerations

**Jung-Edinger-Hillman lineage is**:
- Western depth psychology
- Primarily European heritage
- Assumes certain metaphors (alchemy, Greek myth)

**MAIA attempts to**:
- Include non-Western frameworks (Levin, McGilchrist, Polyvagal)
- But still has Western bias

**Your responsibility**:
- Know your client's cultural context
- Adapt language to their tradition
- Don't force Western alchemy on non-Western clients
- Invite other frameworks into MAIA's intelligence

### 4.4 Avoiding Instrumentalization (Hillman's Warning)

**Hillman cautioned**: Psychology can become another form of domination—soul reduced to technique.

**How to avoid this with MAIA**:

✅ **DO**:
- Use MAIA as *mirror*, not *manager*
- Let mystery remain (don't over-explain)
- Trust the client's process over the algorithm
- Remember: **Intelligence without instrumentalization**

❌ **DON'T**:
- Make transformation a performance ("You should be at 0.75 by now!")
- Gamify (turning soul-work into metrics to optimize)
- Use MAIA to control client ("The data says you need to...")

**The principle**: MAIA reveals patterns. You and client together decide what to do with that revelation.

---

## Part 5: Advanced Practitioner Techniques

### 5.1 Reading Signature Constellations

When multiple signatures appear simultaneously, they interact:

**Example constellation**:
```
Active Signatures:
1. Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation (82%)
2. Self-Attack Cascade (76%)
3. Shadow Projection (64%)
```

**Reading**:
- Primary pattern (82%) is oscillation (skipping middle ground)
- Secondary (76%) shows how: Self-attack interrupts middle states
- Tertiary (64%) shows where shadow goes: Projected onto others

**Intervention**: Address primary first, others will likely resolve.

### 5.2 Tracking Coherence Trends (Not Just Numbers)

**Coherence is not "good = high, bad = low"**

Look at trends:

```
Healthy Descent:
Week 1: 0.68
Week 2: 0.58
Week 3: 0.42
Week 4: 0.38 ← Nigredo entered

This is GOOD (necessary dissolution)
```

vs.

```
Concerning Drop:
Week 1: 0.65
Week 2: 0.45
Week 3: 0.22 ← Rapid crash
Week 4: 0.12 ← Critical

This needs ASSESSMENT (Could be crisis, not transformation)
```

**The difference**: *Speed and context*.

### 5.3 Using Framework Effectiveness Strategically

**Example**:
```
Framework Effectiveness:
- Polyvagal: 88%
- IFS: 82%
- Jung: 52%
```

**Strategy**:
- Start with Polyvagal (nervous system)
- Move to IFS (parts work)
- Introduce Jung later (as readiness increases)

**Monitor**: If Jung effectiveness rises to 75%+, client is ready for deeper alchemical work.

### 5.4 Anima Mundi Context (Hillman Advanced)

When MAIA shows:
```
Anima Mundi Context:
- Ecological events: Wildfire, flooding
- Political events: Uprising, election
- Collective coherence: 0.41 (below average)
```

**Your role**:
- Help client differentiate: "Is this your grief or the world's grief moving through you? (Or both?)"
- Validate appropriate emotional response to world conditions
- Don't pathologize political rage or ecological despair
- Connect to community (not individualize collective pain)

## Part 6: Quick Reference Guides

### 6.1 Coherence Triage Chart

| Coherence | Stage | Immediate Protocol |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| < 0.20 | Nigredo (critical) | Safety assessment, co-regulate, no insight work |
| 0.20-0.30 | Nigredo | Witness darkness, Hillman's "stay in black", gentle presence |
| 0.30-0.50 | Albedo | Support clarification, gentle structure, begin frameworks |
| 0.50-0.75 | Citrinitas | Active integration, synthesis, embodiment preparation |
| > 0.75 | Rubedo | Celebrate wisdom, prepare for next nigredo, multiplicatio |

### 6.2 Operation Quick Reference

| Operation | Element | What's Happening | Intervention Focus |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Calcinatio | Fire | Ego burning | Let inflation die, introduce cooling |
| Solutio | Water | Dissolution | Hold container, validate formlessness |
| Coagulatio | Earth | Structure forming | Support building, not forcing |
| Sublimatio | Air | Rising to vision | Ground the insight, test for bypass |
| Mortificatio | Water/Shadow | Death process | Witness, don't resurrect prematurely |
| Separatio | Air | Differentiation | Support boundaries, withdraw projections |
| Coniunctio | Aether | Union of opposites | Celebrate paradox, embody integration |
| Fermentatio | Fire | Inspiration after death | Channel creative fire, ground it |
| Distillatio | Water | Purification/essence | Extract wisdom, not ruminate |
| 2nd Coagulatio | Earth | New embodiment | Lived wisdom, prepare for next cycle |

### 6.3 When to Refer Out

**Refer to psychiatrist if**:
- Psychosis present
- Mania with significant impairment
- Severe depression not responding
- Medication evaluation needed

**Refer to crisis services if**:
- Imminent suicide risk
- Homicide risk
- Severe self-harm

**Refer to addiction specialist if**:
- Active addiction interfering with transformation work
- Substance use complicating assessment

**You can return to transformation work once stabilized.**

## Part 7: Sample Session Structure

### Session Opening (5 min)
1. Check in: "How are you experiencing yourself today?"
2. Review MAIA dashboard privately (don't show client unless appropriate)
3. Note coherence, stage, operations

### Middle Work (40-45 min)
**Match intervention to stage**:

**If Nigredo (< 0.30)**:
- Primarily witness and co-regulate
- Minimal insight work
- Validate darkness

**If Albedo (0.30-0.50)**:
- Clarification questions
- Gentle structure-building
- Introduce frameworks

**If Citrinitas (0.50-0.75)**:
- Active integration
- Connect insights to body/life
- Synthesis work

**If Rubedo (> 0.75)**:
- Embodiment practices
- Wisdom consolidation
- Prepare for next descent

### Session Close (5-10 min)
1. Ground: "What's one thing you're taking with you?"
2. Preview: "What might be coming next?" (Based on MAIA trajectory)
3. Practice: Suggest one awareness-appropriate practice

---

## Part 8: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "MAIA says Nigredo but client seems fine"

**Possible causes**:
- Client is defended/dissociated (coherence will drop when defenses release)
- MAIA is wrong (check signature confidence—if <70%, be skeptical)
- Your "fine" is their baseline (they're used to low coherence)

**Action**: Trust your clinical judgment. Use MAIA as hypothesis, not fact.

### Issue 2: "Framework effectiveness shows Jung low, but I'm a Jungian analyst"

**Remember**: This is about what works for *this client*, not your expertise.

**Options**:
1. Start with higher-ranked frameworks, introduce Jung gradually
2. Translate Jung into their language
3. Accept some clients need different approaches

### Issue 3: "Coherence isn't changing despite months of work"

**Possible causes**:
- They're in long Nigredo (normal, not failure)
- Stuck in operation (e.g., endless *separatio*, never *coniunctio*)
- External factors (trauma ongoing, environment unsafe)
- Need different framework

**Action**: Look at *which* operations are stuck, intervene there.

### Issue 4: "Client wants to see dashboard, should I show them?"

**Depends on awareness level**:
- **Beginner**: Probably not—too technical, may overwhelm
- **Intermediate**: Maybe—explain carefully
- **Advanced/Master**: Yes—can be empowering

**Guideline**: If showing dashboard supports their agency (not dependence on data), yes. If it creates performance anxiety, no.

## Conclusion: Intelligence in Service of Soul

MAIA is not here to **control** transformation. MAIA is here to **witness** transformation with unprecedented precision, so you and your client can meet it more consciously.

**Your role hasn't changed**: You're still the practitioner, the human presence, the one who holds space.

**What's changed**: You now have a "second opinion" colleague who's read all the books (Jung, Edinger, Hillman), tracked thousands of patterns, and can say: "This looks like *calcinatio* at 82% confidence. What do you want to do with that information?"

**The partnership**:
- **You** bring: Presence, intuition, relationship, human warmth, ethical boundaries
- **MAIA** brings: Pattern recognition, framework synthesis, longitudinal tracking, tireless attention

**Together**: You serve the client's individuation—the ongoing, spiraling, never-finished process of becoming who they actually are.

**Final word from Hillman**:

> *"The cure is not adjustment to the world. The cure is in the soul's deepening, its going on."*

MAIA helps you track the deepening. Your presence helps them go on.
