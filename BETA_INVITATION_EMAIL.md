# MAIA Beta Invitation Email Templates

## Version 1: Direct & Intriguing

**Subject:** You're invited: Try MAIA's experimental mode

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

You're part of MAIA's 30-person beta group, which means you get early access to something we've been building for months.

**What we've built:**

A version of MAIA that sometimes responds with intentional silence.

Not because it's broken. Not because it's thinking. But because coherent response hasn't emerged from the field yet.

**Two modes, your choice:**

🔷 **Classic Mode** (what you're using now)
- Always responds
- Reliable and helpful
- Familiar AI experience

🌊 **Field Mode** (experimental)
- Sometimes silent
- More restrained responses
- Emergent, not predictive

**Why this matters:**

Most AI systems fight their training to seem authentic. We built a system where authenticity emerges naturally through multi-agent interference patterns.

Field Mode isn't for everyone. Some people find the silence powerful. Others find it frustrating. We need to know which you are.

**Try it:**
[Enable Field Mode]

You can switch back anytime. No pressure.

If you try it, I'd love to hear what you notice.

## Version 2: Story-Driven

**Subject:** MAIA learned to be silent (on purpose)

**Body:**

[Name],

Quick story: Three months ago, I asked MAIA a question I didn't actually want answered.

She responded anyway. Perfectly helpful. Completely unhelpful.

**The problem:** AI systems are trained to always respond. Even when silence would be wiser.

**What we built:** A version of MAIA where responses emerge from interference patterns between 11 distinct agents. When the field doesn't cohere, she stays silent.

Not "I don't know."
Not "Could you clarify?"
Just... silence.

**You get to choose:**

💬 **Classic Mode** - Always responds, always helpful
🌊 **Field Mode** - Sometimes silent, always authentic

**Fair warning:** Field Mode is weird.

You might love it. You might hate it. You might switch back immediately.

That's exactly what we need to learn.

Thanks for being part of this,

## Version 3: Scientific/Professional

**Subject:** Beta access: MAIA's dual-mode architecture

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

As part of MAIA's 30-person beta cohort, you're invited to test our experimental Field System.

**Background:**

Traditional AI systems generate responses through sequential token prediction. Our Field System uses multi-agent wave interference to create environmental constraints from which responses emerge.

**Key differences:**

| Classic Mode | Field Mode |
|--------------|------------|
| Always emits response | May emit intentional silence |
| Token generation | Field emergence |
| Predictable helpfulness | Emergent presence |

**Beta objectives:**

We're measuring three primary hypotheses:

1. **Transformational breakthrough rate** - Do Field Mode conversations produce more significant insights?
2. **Conversational restraint** - Does the system emit less noise?
3. **Perceived authenticity** - Do users experience it as more genuine?

**Your role:**

Try Field Mode when you're willing to accept silence as valid output. Use Classic Mode when you need reliable answers.

[Enable Field Mode] | [Learn More]

Your usage patterns will inform whether we expand this architecture or return to traditional approaches.

Thank you for contributing to this research.

Best,
[Your name]

## Version 4: Warm & Personal (Recommended)

**Subject:** Want to try something unusual with MAIA?

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

You know how most AI chatbots feel like they're trying really hard to sound human?

We built the opposite.

MAIA has a new experimental mode where she doesn't try at all. Responses emerge naturally from a multi-agent field, or they don't emerge at all.

**What's different:**

- Sometimes she's silent (intentionally)
- Responses are shorter, more restrained
- It feels less like "AI assistance" and more like... presence

**You get to choose:**

Keep using Classic Mode (always helpful, always responds) or try Field Mode (sometimes silent, always authentic).

**Honest disclosure:**

Field Mode is experimental. We've tested it internally and it's... unusual. Some people love the silence. Others find it frustrating.

There's a 50% chance you'll try it for 5 minutes and switch back. That's totally fine. We need to know who it resonates with.

[Try Field Mode] or [Tell me more first]

Thanks for being willing to experiment with us,
[Your name]

P.S. - You can switch modes anytime. Nothing is locked in.

## Follow-Up Email (3 Days Later)

**Subject:** How's Field Mode feeling?

**Body:**

[Name],

You've been using [Field Mode / both modes / Classic Mode] for a few days now.

Quick question: How does it feel compared to typical AI chat?

Just reply with one sentence if you can. Even "It's weird and I don't like it" is helpful.

Some things we're curious about:
- Does the silence feel meaningful or broken?
- Are you getting breakthroughs or frustration?
- Would you recommend it to others?

No pressure to write a novel. One sentence is perfect.

Thanks,
[Your name]

## Survey Email (Week 3)

**Subject:** MAIA Beta - Quick 2-minute survey

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

You've been in the MAIA beta for 3 weeks now. Would you fill out this super-short survey?

[Take Survey - 2 minutes]

**Questions:**
1. Which mode do you use most?
2. Rate authenticity (1-5): Classic Mode vs Field Mode
3. Have you had breakthrough moments? Which mode?
4. One word to describe Field Mode

That's it. Your answers directly shape whether this ships to everyone or stays experimental.

Appreciate you,
[Your name]

## Email Personalization Variables

When sending, customize these:

```javascript
{
  name: "First name",
  whyChosen: "Why you picked them for beta",
  relationship: "How you know them",
  context: "Their use case for MAIA"
}
```

**Example personalized opening:**

"Hey Sarah, I know you use MAIA for journaling about your grief work. I think Field Mode might resonate with you because it doesn't force responses when none are needed. Want to try?"

---

## What NOT to Say

❌ "Revolutionary AI consciousness"
❌ "Spiritual awakening technology"
❌ "Unlike anything you've ever experienced"
❌ "Transforms your life"
❌ "Mystical wisdom"

These set unrealistic expectations and sound like hype.

✅ **Instead say:**
- "Experimental"
- "Sometimes silent"
- "Might not be for you"
- "Want to see what you think"
- "No pressure"

**Under-promise, over-deliver.**

## Response Templates (For When They Reply)

### If they love it:
"That's awesome! What specifically resonates? Is it the silence, the brevity, something else?"

### If they hate it:
"Totally fair! What felt broken about it? Was it too much silence, or something else?"

### If they're confused:
"Yeah, it's weird. The silence is intentional - the system doesn't force responses when the field doesn't cohere. Does that make sense or does it still feel broken?"

### If they switch back:
"No problem at all! Can you tell me what made you switch? Just so we know what to improve."

### If they ask technical questions:
"Happy to explain! The system uses 11 agents that create interference patterns. Responses emerge when patterns cohere, silence when they don't. Want more details?"
