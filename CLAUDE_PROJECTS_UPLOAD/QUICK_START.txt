🔮 CLAUDE PROJECTS - 15-MINUTE QUICK START
==========================================

AFTER Monday launch, do this to give MAIA deep framework knowledge:

STEP 1: Create Project (5 mins)
--------------------------------
1. Go to: https://claude.ai/projects
2. Click "Create New Project"
3. Name: "MAIA Framework Knowledge - Elemental Alchemy"
4. Paste instructions from: 00_UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md (section "Add Project Instructions")
5. Click "Save"


STEP 2: Upload These 6 Files (5 mins)
--------------------------------------
Drag & drop all files from THIS folder:
✅ INSIDE_OUT_SPIRALOGIC_INTEGRATION.md
✅ CREATIVE_DIRECTION_BIBLE.md
✅ ElementalAlchemyKnowledge.md
✅ MAIA_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md
✅ CRITICAL_FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md
✅ MONDAY_LAUNCH_READINESS.md


STEP 3: Test It (5 mins)
-------------------------
In Claude Projects, ask:
"User says: I feel stuck in the same patterns"

Expected response should include:
- Earth energy recognition
- Dialectical structure (machine + cultural)
- Sacred language patterns


STEP 4: Get Project ID (1 min)
-------------------------------
Look at URL: https://claude.ai/projects/proj_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Copy: proj_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Save it for later (optional API integration)


THAT'S IT! ✅
-----------
MAIA now has permanent deep knowledge of your framework.

No code changes needed - it works automatically with your API key.


LATER (Optional):
-----------------
- Add your Elemental Alchemy manuscript
- Upload Spiralogic Polar Archetype Map
- Add Soullab vault notes
- Include white paper & agent designs

Each addition makes MAIA wiser without any code changes!
