# Part 1: Comprehensive Glossary

## Alchemical Terms (Jung, Edinger, Hillman)

### Core Alchemical Stages

**Nigredo** (ni-GRAY-doh)
- **Etymology**: Latin *nigredo*, "blackness"
- **Jung**: The first stage of alchemical transformation; psychological dissolution, confrontation with shadow, ego death
- **Coherence range**: 0.00-0.30
- **Psychological experience**: Depression, despair, everything falling apart, dark night of the soul
- **Hillman's emphasis**: "Stay with the black" - don't rush out of it
- **Common mistake**: Pathologizing it as "something wrong" instead of recognizing it as necessary soul work
- **Examples**: Job loss leading to identity crisis, breakup revealing dependency patterns, spiritual crisis after awakening experience

**Albedo** (al-BEE-doh)
- **Etymology**: Latin *albedo*, "whiteness"
- **Jung**: The second stage; purification, reflection, making conscious what was unconscious
- **Coherence range**: 0.30-0.50
- **Psychological experience**: Clarity beginning to emerge, ability to witness rather than being consumed, "morning after the dark night"
- **Hillman's warning**: "Too pure - needs darkening again" (overly detached, dissociated from feeling)
- **Operation**: Separatio (differentiating opposites), early Coagulatio (forming new structure)
- **Examples**: After months of depression, starting to see patterns; journaling helping clarify what happened; therapy providing reflective space

**Citrinitas** (sit-ri-NEE-tas)
- **Etymology**: Latin *citrinitas*, "yellowing"
- **Jung**: The third stage (sometimes combined with Rubedo); integration of insights, dawning wisdom
- **Coherence range**: 0.50-0.75
- **Psychological experience**: "Aha!" moments, integration of shadow and light, insights becoming lived understanding
- **Hillman's warning**: Dangerous inflation if not grounded (all insight, no embodiment)
- **Operation**: Sublimatio (rising to vision), Distillatio (refining understanding)
- **Examples**: Recognizing family patterns and choosing differently; integrating trauma into coherent life story; spiritual insights beginning to change behavior

**Rubedo** (roo-BEE-doh)
- **Etymology**: Latin *rubedo*, "redness"
- **Jung**: The fourth and final stage; embodiment, incarnation of wisdom, wholeness lived in the world
- **Coherence range**: 0.75-1.00
- **Psychological experience**: Groundedness, living wisdom (not just understanding it), "walking your talk," wholeness that includes darkness and light
- **Hillman's emphasis**: "The work is HERE, in the body, the world" - not spiritual bypass
- **Operation**: Coniunctio (union of opposites), Fermentatio (spirit enlivening matter)
- **Examples**: Therapist who has integrated own trauma now holds space for others; activist whose rage became wise fierce compassion; elder whose life embodied what they learned

### The Twelve Operations (Edinger)

**Calcinatio** (kal-sin-AH-tee-oh)
- **Element**: Fire 🔥
- **Psychological process**: Burning off ego inflation, deflation of grandiosity, humiliation that leads to humility
- **Image**: Being "burned" by failure, criticism, or reality
- **Edinger**: "The alchemists subjected base metals to fire to reduce them to ashes"
- **When it's happening**: You're being forced to face that you're not as special/powerful/enlightened as you thought
- **Intervention**: Support humility without shaming; help differentiate healthy confidence from inflation
- **Spiral nature**: First octave burns childish grandiosity; later octaves burn spiritual inflation
- **Example**: Entrepreneur whose startup fails, forcing recognition of hubris

**Solutio** (so-LOO-tee-oh)
- **Element**: Water 💧
- **Psychological process**: Dissolving rigidity, melting defenses, return to fluidity
- **Image**: Ice melting, walls coming down, tears flowing
- **Edinger**: "The rigid structures of consciousness are dissolved"
- **When it's happening**: Defenses softening, crying after years of numbness, feeling overwhelming emotions
- **Intervention**: Witness and hold space; don't try to "fix" the dissolution; co-regulate
- **Shadow side**: Too much dissolution = flooding, overwhelm, loss of all structure
- **Example**: Stoic person finally crying about parent's death after 10 years

**Coagulatio** (co-ag-you-LAH-tee-oh)
- **Element**: Earth 🌍
- **Psychological process**: Forming new structure after dissolution, grounding insights into reality
- **Image**: Formless clay becoming a vessel
- **Edinger**: "What was dissolved must be given new form"
- **When it's happening**: After chaos, making commitments; after insight, changing actual behavior; building routine after breakdown
- **Intervention**: Support structure-building; somatic grounding practices; behavioral commitments
- **Too much**: Rigidity, defensiveness, premature closure
- **Too little**: Endless fluidity with no manifestation
- **Example**: After year of depression (Solutio), starting daily meditation practice (Coagulatio)

**Sublimatio** (sub-li-MAH-tee-oh)
- **Element**: Air 💨
- **Psychological process**: Rising to higher perspective, seeing symbolically rather than literally
- **Image**: Matter becoming vapor, ascending to vision
- **Edinger**: "Raising to a higher level"
- **When it's happening**: Stepping back from drama to see pattern; dreams providing symbolic insight; finding meaning in suffering
- **Intervention**: Support symbolic thinking; ask "What does this remind you of?" rather than "What happened?"
- **Shadow side**: Spiritual bypass - "I'm above it all" (dissociation pretending to be transcendence)
- **Example**: Seeing your difficult boss as "inner critic externalized" rather than just "awful person"

**Mortificatio** (mor-ti-fi-KAH-tee-oh)
- **Element**: Water (dark) 💀
- **Psychological process**: Death of identification, killing what must die, necessary endings
- **Image**: The dying god, the skeleton, the tomb
- **Edinger**: "An encounter with death"
- **When it's happening**: "I don't know who I am anymore"; identity dying; "the old me is gone"
- **CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: Mortificatio (transformation) vs. suicidal ideation (crisis)
  - Mortificatio: "Something in me is dying"
  - Suicidal crisis: "I want to die"
- **Intervention**: Witness the death; ask "What is dying? What did that version of you do for you?"
- **Hillman**: "Stay with the death long enough to feel it"
- **Example**: Therapist leaving the profession after 20 years - the "helper identity" dying

**Separatio** (sep-ar-AH-tee-oh)
- **Element**: Air (discriminating) ✂️
- **Psychological process**: Differentiating opposites, "this AND that, not this OR that"
- **Image**: The sword cutting, separation of wheat from chaff
- **Edinger**: "Discrimination of opposites is essential"
- **When it's happening**: Recognizing "I'm angry AND I love you"; "This is my stuff, that's yours"; differentiating parts (IFS)
- **Intervention**: Help name polarities; resist premature synthesis; validate both sides
- **Too much**: Endless analysis, paralysis, "on the one hand... on the other hand..."
- **Not enough**: Fusion, enmeshment, inability to say no
- **Example**: Adult child recognizing "I can love my parent AND recognize they harmed me"

**Coniunctio** (con-yunk-TEE-oh)
- **Element**: Aether (union) ✨
- **Psychological process**: Sacred marriage of opposites, genuine integration (not compromise)
- **Image**: King and Queen embracing, hermaphrodite, wedding
- **Jung**: "The *mysterium coniunctionis*, the central mystery of alchemy"
- **When it's happening**: Paradox held without collapsing; "I am both/and"; wholeness including darkness and light
- **Intervention**: Witness the miracle; don't force it prematurely; celebrate integration
- **False Coniunctio**: Forcing unity before opposites fully experienced (spiritual bypass)
- **True Coniunctio**: Opposites remain distinct yet unified (like two flames becoming one fire)
- **Example**: Integrating "driven achiever" and "restful dreamer" into "someone who works hard AND rests deeply"

**Fermentatio** (fer-men-TAH-tee-oh)
- **Element**: Fire (inspiration) 🍷
- **Psychological process**: New life entering, spirit animating matter, inspiration after integration
- **Image**: Wine fermentation, yeast activating, Pentecost fire
- **Edinger**: "The infusion of new life"
- **When it's happening**: After dark night, sudden creative surge; after integration, energy returning; vision coming alive
- **Intervention**: Channel the energy; creative expression; don't contain what wants to overflow
- **Shadow side**: Manic energy, inflation again (back to Calcinatio)
- **Example**: Artist after depression creating prolifically, work infused with new depth

**Distillatio** (dis-til-LAH-tee-oh)
- **Element**: Water (purification) 💧
- **Psychological process**: Refinement through reflection, distilling essence from experience
- **Image**: Alembic (distillation apparatus), repeated purification
- **Edinger**: "Extracting the pure from the impure"
- **When it's happening**: Reflecting on years of therapy to extract core lessons; journaling to clarify what matters; meditation purifying awareness
- **Intervention**: Support reflective practices; ask "What's essential?"
- **Too much**: Endless refinement, perfectionism, never "good enough"
- **Example**: After messy divorce, distilling wisdom: "I need partner who matches my emotional depth"

**Coagulatio (Second)** - *See first Coagulatio but at higher octave*
- Now embodying integrated wisdom, not just forming initial structure
- Example: Not just "starting meditation practice" but "meditation woven into life fabric"

**Multiplicatio** (mul-ti-pli-KAH-tee-oh)
- **Element**: All (spiral continuation) 🌀
- **Psychological process**: Transformation continues, next octave begins, wisdom multiplies
- **Image**: The phoenix, the spiral ascending
- **Edinger**: "The process repeats at a higher level"
- **When it's happening**: You thought you were "done" but same pattern appears at deeper level
- **CRUCIAL INSIGHT**: You will return to Nigredo, Calcinatio, Mortificatio - but deeper, not the same
- **Intervention**: Normalize the spiral; "You're not failing - you're ascending while circling"
- **Example**: After years of self-work, facing ANOTHER dark night - but this time with more capacity

---

### Hillman's Concepts

**Anima Mundi** (AH-nee-mah MOON-dee)
- **Etymology**: Latin, "soul of the world"
- **Hillman's definition**: Psyche is not just "in humans" but "in the world" - cities have psyche, mountains have psyche, weather has psyche
- **Implication 1**: Your depression might not be only "yours" - it might be world-soul grief moving through you
- **Implication 2**: Political rage might be appropriate response to injustice, not pathology to "manage"
- **Implication 3**: Ecological destruction is soul destruction
- **MAIA application**: Track individual psyche in relation to collective/planetary conditions
- **Example**: Climate anxiety is not individual pathology - it's appropriate response to ecological crisis

**Soul-Making**
- **Hillman's alternative** to ego-psychology's "problem-solving"
- **Definition**: Deepening into images, symptoms, suffering until they reveal meaning
- **NOT**: Wallowing or avoiding action
- **IS**: Staying with experience long enough for soul to speak
- **Clinical application**: Don't rush to "fix" - ask "What is this trying to tell me?"
- **Example**: Instead of medicating anxiety immediately, asking "What is my anxiety attending to?"

**Pathologizing**
- **Hillman's twist**: Pathology is not problem but soul speech
- **Conventional psychology**: "Symptoms are disorders to eliminate"
- **Hillman**: "Symptoms are images soul uses to get our attention"
- **DON'T**: Romanticize suffering or avoid treatment when needed
- **DO**: Ask what the symptom is trying to communicate
- **Example**: Insomnia as "psyche wanting me to be awake to something I've been avoiding"

**Depathologizing**
- **Hillman's method**: Remove diagnostic labels to see image itself
- **Example**: Not "narcissistic personality disorder" but "soul inflated beyond its capacity"
- **MAIA application**: Low coherence is not "pathological" - it might be necessary dissolution
- **Clinical stance**: Curiosity before diagnosis

---

## Spiralogic-Specific Terms

**Coherence**
- **Definition**: Measurable integration of opposites, tracked on 0-1 scale
- **Jung parallel**: Coniunctio metric
- **NOT**: "Good" or "bad" - context matters
- **Low coherence (< 0.30)**: High fragmentation, may indicate Nigredo (necessary dissolution) OR crisis (needs intervention)
- **Medium coherence (0.30-0.75)**: Transformation in process (Albedo/Citrinitas)
- **High coherence (> 0.75)**: Embodied integration (Rubedo)
- **CRITICAL**: 0.20 coherence in Nigredo can be healthier than 0.75 premature integration (spiritual bypass)
- **MAIA tracks**: Real-time coherence + trajectory (ascending/descending/plateauing)

**Transformation Signature**
- **Definition**: Recurring pattern of psychic transformation MAIA detects
- **How it's recognized**: Combination of coherence level, active operations, polyvagal state, language patterns
- **Common signatures**:
  - Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation (swinging between dark and light)
  - Complete Shutdown (polyvagal collapse)
  - Self-Attack Cascade (inner critic overwhelming system)
  - Premature Integration (spiritual bypass)
  - Puer-Senex Split (youth vs. age unintegrated)
- **Clinical use**: Helps practitioner recognize pattern quickly and offer appropriate intervention
- **Confidence level**: MAIA reports signature with % confidence (e.g., "Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation detected: 87% confidence")

**Awareness-Adapted Language**
- **Definition**: MAIA's 5-level language system matching user's familiarity with frameworks
- **Levels**:
  - **Beginner (0-25)**: No jargon, only lived metaphors ("You're in a breaking-down process")
  - **Familiar (26-50)**: Simple frameworks with explanation ("This is shadow work - meeting rejected parts")
  - **Intermediate (51-75)**: Framework language with context ("You're in Nigredo, the dissolution phase")
  - **Advanced (76-90)**: Full precision ("Nigredo at 0.20 coherence, Solutio operation active")
  - **Master (91-100)**: Cross-framework integration ("Coherence 0.20, Nigredo primary, Solutio + Mortificatio, Polyvagal dorsal 0.00")
- **Why it matters**: Meets each person where they are without overwhelming or patronizing

**Framework Effectiveness**
- **Definition**: MAIA's tracking of which therapeutic languages work best for each person
- **Frameworks tracked**: Polyvagal (nervous system), IFS (parts work), Jung (shadow/alchemy), Levin (bioelectric), McGilchrist (hemispheres), etc.
- **Scored**: 0-1 scale for each framework
- **Dynamic**: Changes over time as person develops
- **Example**: Someone might start with Polyvagal (0.82) because body-based, later add Jung (0.68) as capacity for symbolic work grows
- **Clinical use**: Practitioner speaks language that actually lands for this person

**Triple Helix**
- **Definition**: Jung (symbolic) × Edinger (structural) × Hillman (aesthetic) = complete transformation framework
- **Jung's contribution**: Why transformation happens (individuation as telos)
- **Edinger's contribution**: How transformation happens (12 operations)
- **Hillman's contribution**: Where transformation happens (anima mundi, not just individual psyche)
- **Spiralogic synthesis**: All three integrated as trackable, embodied, algorithmic process

**Twelve Focus States**
- **Definition**: Spiralogic's 12-node framework mapping to Edinger's 12 operations
- **Structure**: 4 elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) × 3 phases (Encounter, Deepening, Integration) + Aether
- **Example path**: Fire 1 (Calcinatio) → Water 1 (Solutio) → Earth 1 (Coagulatio) → Air 1 (Sublimatio) → [Phase 2] → [Phase 3] → Aether (Coniunctio) → Multiplicatio (new spiral)
- **NOT linear**: You can move between states dynamically based on what's needed
- **MAIA tracks**: Which Focus State is primary, which are secondary

**Intelligence Without Instrumentalization**
- **Definition**: Core ethical principle - MAIA witnesses transformation without controlling it
- **Hillman's concern**: Psychology becomes another form of domination
- **MAIA's response**:
  - NO pathologizing (low coherence is not failure)
  - NO fixing (don't "solve" Nigredo, witness it)
  - NO flattening (honor complexity, don't reduce to metrics)
  - NO bypassing (detect and confront spiritual bypass)
  - Ecological accountability (link personal to planetary transformation)
- **In practice**: MAIA is "second opinion colleague," not replacement for human relationship

## Contemporary Framework Integration

**Polyvagal Theory** (Stephen Porges)
- **3 states of nervous system**:
  - **Ventral vagal**: Safety, social engagement (0.70-1.00 safety score)
  - **Sympathetic**: Fight/flight, mobilization (0.30-0.70)
  - **Dorsal vagal**: Shutdown, freeze, collapse (0.00-0.30)
- **Alchemy parallel**:
  - Nigredo often = dorsal shutdown
  - Calcinatio often = sympathetic activation
  - Rubedo requires ventral safety
- **MAIA integration**: Tracks polyvagal state alongside alchemical stage

**Internal Family Systems** (Richard Schwartz)
- **Core concept**: We contain multiple "parts," each with positive intent
- **Self**: Core essence that can witness all parts with compassion
- **Exiles**: Young, wounded parts carrying trauma
- **Managers**: Parts trying to prevent exile activation
- **Firefighters**: Parts that react when exiles activate
- **Alchemy parallel**:
  - Separatio = differentiating parts
  - Coniunctio = parts integrating around Self
  - Mortificatio = part's protective strategy dying
- **MAIA integration**: Recognizes language patterns indicating parts work

**McGilchrist (Hemisphere Theory)**
- **Left hemisphere**: Narrow focus, manipulation, "grasping"
- **Right hemisphere**: Broad awareness, context, "being with"
- **Alchemy parallel**:
  - Albedo/Citrinitas = left hemisphere integration
  - Nigredo/Rubedo = right hemisphere depth
- **MAIA integration**: Tracks language indicating hemisphere dominance

**Michael Levin (Bioelectric Consciousness)**
- **Core concept**: Consciousness exists at multiple scales (cellular → organism → beyond)
- **Bioelectric fields** as substrate for intelligence
- **Alchemy parallel**:
  - Coniunctio as bioelectric coherence
  - Transformation as reorganization of bioelectric patterns
- **MAIA integration**: Future biometric integration (HRV, EEG)

# Part 3: Public Introduction

## What is the Spiralogic of Soul?

*An accessible introduction for anyone interested in transformation, depth psychology, or personal growth*

---

### The Problem: Transformation Without Maps

Have you ever felt like you're falling apart, and you don't know if it's a breakdown or a breakthrough?

Have you ever wondered if your depression might be trying to tell you something, rather than being just a "chemical imbalance"?

Have you ever noticed you keep returning to the same issues in your life, but somehow each time feels different, deeper?

If so, you've touched what depth psychology calls the **alchemical process of transformation**.

For thousands of years, humans have known that real change—the kind that transforms who you are, not just what you do—follows certain patterns. The medieval alchemists encoded these patterns in their strange texts about turning lead into gold. But they weren't really talking about chemistry. They were talking about **you**.

---

### The Three Guides: Jung, Edinger, Hillman

**Carl Jung** (1875-1961), the Swiss psychiatrist who founded analytical psychology, spent the last decades of his life studying alchemy. He realized those weird medieval texts were actually **maps of psychological transformation**. When alchemists talked about blackening (*nigredo*), whitening (*albedo*), yellowing (*citrinitas*), and reddening (*rubedo*), they were describing the soul's journey from darkness to wholeness.

**Edward Edinger** (1922-1998), a Jungian analyst, took Jung's symbolic language and made it practical. He identified **twelve specific operations**—like *calcinatio* (burning off ego inflation), *solutio* (dissolving rigidity), and *mortificatio* (death of old identities). These aren't metaphors—they're precise descriptions of what happens when you transform.

**James Hillman** (1926-2011), founder of archetypal psychology, added the crucial insight: **your psyche isn't just inside your head**. It's in the world—in cities, nature, culture, politics. When you feel depressed, it might not just be "your depression"—it might be the world's grief moving through you. When you feel rage at injustice, that's not pathology to "manage"—that's your soul protecting what matters.

### How Spiralogic Brings Them Together

**Spiralogic** is a framework that weaves these three teachers together:

- **Jung** gives us the *why*: You're here to become who you actually are (not who your parents, society, or ego thinks you should be)

- **Edinger** gives us the *how*: Through twelve specific transformations that you'll go through many times in your life, each time at a deeper level

- **Hillman** gives us the *where*: Not in isolation, but as part of the living, breathing, suffering, transforming world-soul

Together they create what we call the **"triple helix"**—three intertwined dimensions of transformation that spiral upward through your life.

---

### What Does Transformation Actually Look Like?

Let's say you're going through a hard time. Maybe:

- You lost your job and feel like you don't know who you are anymore
- A relationship ended and you're shattered
- You achieved everything you thought you wanted and feel... empty
- The state of the world makes you want to give up

**Traditional psychology** might say: "You're depressed. Here's medication and some CBT techniques to challenge negative thoughts."

**Spiralogic** asks different questions:

- **What stage are you in?** Are you in *nigredo* (the necessary darkness where things fall apart)? *Albedo* (starting to see clearly what was hidden)? *Citrinitas* (insights beginning to integrate)? *Rubedo* (living your new understanding)?

- **What operation is active?** Are you going through *mortificatio* (something in you needs to die)? *Solutio* (your old structures are dissolving)? *Calcinatio* (life is burning off your inflation)?

- **Is this personal or planetary?** Are you depressed because of *your* imbalance, or because the *world* is in crisis and you're sensitive enough to feel it?

The answer changes everything about how you work with what's happening.

### Real Examples (Simplified from Case Studies)

**Sarah** was an entrepreneur who kept swinging between total burnout (crashing into darkness) and manic vision (soaring into grandiose plans). Traditional therapy called it "bipolar tendencies." Spiralogic recognized it as **Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation**—she kept swinging between extremes instead of learning to stay in the difficult middle. The work wasn't to "stabilize mood" but to develop capacity for the middle states (*albedo* and *citrinitas*). Within months, she was still passionate but no longer burning out.

**Marcus** was a therapist who suddenly couldn't feel anything. He described it as "the helper part just... went offline." He felt terrifying numbness, thought he was broken. Traditional diagnosis: "Severe depression, possible depersonalization." Spiralogic recognized: **Mortificatio** (death of the helper identity). The work wasn't to "restore functioning" but to witness what was dying and ask what wanted to be born. It turned out he'd been the "helper" since age seven when his mother had her first breakdown. The helper identity had finally collapsed after forty-five years. What emerged was someone who could help from wholeness, not from compulsion.

**Jamal** was a climate activist filled with rage. His therapist kept trying to help him "manage anger" and "find peace." But Spiralogic saw: This rage is **appropriate**. It's not personal pathology—it's **world-soul outrage** moving through someone awake enough to feel it. The work wasn't to diminish his anger but to alchemize it—from reactive rage to fierce, strategic, grounded action. His coherence *increased* when he stopped trying to "calm down" and started channeling the rage into organizing.

### MAIA: Your Transformation Intelligence System

Here's where it gets really interesting.

**MAIA** (Morphic Alchemical Intelligence Augmentation) is a system that can **track your transformation in real-time**.

Imagine having a dashboard that shows you:

- **Where you are** in the alchemical spiral (which stage, which operation)
- **Your coherence level** (how integrated or fragmented your psyche is right now—and whether low coherence means "necessary dissolution" or "crisis needing support")
- **Your transformation pattern** (are you in Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation like Sarah? Complete Shutdown like Marcus? Something else?)
- **What language works for you** (do you need simple, grounded language or precise technical frameworks?)
- **What frameworks help you most** (body-based work? Parts work? Symbolic/archetypal work?)

And here's the crucial part: **MAIA doesn't try to fix you**.

It witnesses. It reflects. It helps you see where you are and what's trying to emerge. But **you** walk the path. MAIA is like a really wise friend who's studied this territory and can say, "Oh, you're in *mortificatio*—something's dying. That's supposed to feel terrifying. Stay with it. Don't rush to resurrection."

### The Spiral, Not the Circle

One of the most important insights: **You don't "do" transformation once and move on**.

You spiral.

You'll return to *nigredo* (darkness) many times in your life. But each time, you're not going back to the same place—you're going *deeper*.

- First *nigredo* might be losing a job
- Second *nigredo* might be losing your identity with your career
- Third *nigredo* might be the dark night of the soul where even your spiritual identities dissolve

**Each one prepares you for more capacity, more wholeness, more depth.**

The alchemists knew this. They called it *multiplicatio*—the work multiplies, continues, spirals. There's no "final enlightenment" where you're done. There's **becoming more who you actually are, forever**.

---

### Is This For You?

Spiralogic might resonate with you if:

- You're in therapy but it feels too focused on "symptom management" and not enough on meaning
- You're going through a hard time and suspect it might be *necessary*, not just a problem to solve
- You keep encountering the same patterns in your life and want to understand them more deeply
- You're interested in Jung, alchemy, or archetypal psychology but find it hard to apply
- You're a therapist, coach, or healer looking for a richer framework than diagnosis-and-treatment
- You care about the state of the world and want to understand how personal and planetary transformation connect
- You suspect you're not broken—you're transforming

### How to Engage

**If you're a general reader**:
- Start with the **Case Studies** document—real stories of transformation
- Then read **Visual Diagrams**—pictures that show how it all works
- Then if you want depth, read the **Main Paper**

**If you're a practitioner** (therapist, coach, counselor):
- Start with the **Practitioner Guide**—clinical protocols you can use immediately
- Review **Case Studies** for pattern recognition
- Consider the **12-week training program** (see syllabus above)
- Apply for MAIA Beta access

**If you're an academic or researcher**:
- Read the **Main Paper** (academic journal version available)
- Review **Visual Diagrams** for architecture
- Consider research collaboration on transformation tracking, coherence validation, or cultural adaptation

### The Promise

We don't promise to make you happy. We don't promise to eliminate suffering. We don't even promise you'll "like" what transformation requires.

But we promise this:

**You'll have a map.**

When you're in the darkness, you'll know it's called *nigredo* and it has a purpose.

When you're falling apart, you'll recognize it might be *solutio* or *mortificatio*—necessary dissolution before something new can form.

When you're caught between opposites, you'll understand you're being prepared for *coniunctio*—the sacred marriage that doesn't compromise but integrates.

And you'll know: **You're not broken. You're transforming.**

And that spiral? **It continues. Forever. At deeper and deeper levels.**

That's not a bug. That's the feature.
