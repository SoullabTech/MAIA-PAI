**Client Information**:
- Client Name: ______________________

- Date: ______________________

### WHAT IS MAIA?

MAIA (Multi-framework AI for Integration and Analysis) is an artificial intelligence tool that helps your therapist provide better clinical care by analyzing session recordings and offering supervision-style feedback.

**Think of MAIA like**:
- A fitness tracker for therapy sessions
- A second opinion your therapist can consult
- A supervisor who helps your therapist notice patterns

**What MAIA does**:
- Listens to recordings of our sessions together
- Helps your therapist recognize patterns and choose therapeutic approaches
- Provides feedback to your therapist (not directly to you)
- Flags moments your therapist might want to revisit

**What MAIA does NOT do**:
- Replace your therapist or make decisions about your treatment
- Diagnose you or tell your therapist what's "wrong"
- Talk to you directly
- Replace your therapist's clinical supervisor

---

### HOW MAIA WORKS

Your therapist may use MAIA in two ways:

**Real-Time Mode** (during our sessions):
- Your therapist may have a device showing MAIA's analysis during our session
- You won't see this device
- MAIA provides gentle suggestions your therapist may or may not use
- Your therapist remains fully present with you

**Post-Session Mode** (after our sessions):
- Your therapist uploads a recording of our session
- MAIA analyzes it and creates a supervision report
- Your therapist reviews this report and may share insights with you if helpful

---

### YOUR PRIVACY

**How your information is protected**:
- All recordings are encrypted (scrambled so no one else can access them)
- MAIA complies with HIPAA (federal privacy law for health information)
- Your data is never sold or shared with third parties
- Recordings are stored securely and deleted according to the timeline you choose below

**Who has access**:

---

### THERAPY vs. EVALUATION

**I understand the difference**:

**Therapy with MAIA** (this treatment):

- Confidentiality: Standard therapy confidentiality applies (with exceptions below)
- MAIA's role: Help therapist provide better clinical care

**Forensic Evaluation** (separate process if needed):
- Purpose: Answer legal questions for the court
- Confidentiality: Limited or none; report goes to court
- Evaluation methods: Different from therapy

---

### MANDATED REPORTING & COURT REQUIREMENTS

**I understand that my therapist must**:

- [ ] Report suspected child/elder abuse (mandated by law)
- [ ] Report imminent danger to self or others
- [ ] Comply with court orders (e.g., subpoenas, progress reports)
- [ ] Provide proof of attendance if required by court

**MAIA's role in mandated reporting**:
- [ ] MAIA may flag potential reportable situations (abuse, danger)
- [ ] **My therapist** (not MAIA) determines whether reporting is required
- [ ] My therapist's professional and legal judgment governs

---

### VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION WITH MAIA

**Even though my therapy may be mandated, MAIA use is voluntary**:

- [ ] I understand that declining MAIA does **NOT** mean I'm declining therapy
- [ ] If court requires therapy, I can still meet that requirement without MAIA
- [ ] My therapist can provide mandated therapy and court documentation without MAIA

**I choose**:

- [ ] **Yes**, I consent to MAIA being used in my mandated therapy
- [ ] **No**, I decline MAIA, but I consent to mandated therapy without MAIA

---

### CONFIDENTIALITY LIMITS

**In legal cases, therapy confidentiality may be limited**:

- [ ] Court may subpoena therapy records
- [ ] Therapist may be required to provide progress reports to court/probation
- [ ] If I raise my mental health as legal defense, privilege may be waived

**MAIA-specific confidentiality**:
- [ ] If therapy records are subpoenaed, MAIA analyses may be included
- [ ] However, MAIA analyses are **clinical notes**, not forensic assessments
- [ ] I understand courts should not rely on MAIA for legal determinations

---

### CONSENT STATEMENT

**I confirm**:

- [ ] I have read and understood this forensic/mandated client addendum
- [ ] I understand MAIA is a clinical tool, not a forensic evaluation tool
- [ ] I understand the difference between therapy and forensic evaluation
- [ ] I understand my therapy may have reduced confidentiality due to legal case
