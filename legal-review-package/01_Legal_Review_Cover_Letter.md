# LEGAL REVIEW COVER LETTER

**To**: [Your Attorney Name/Law Firm]
**From**: Soullab Collective
**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Re**: Legal Review of MAIA (Multi-framework AI for Integration and Analysis) System

---

Dear [Attorney Name],

We are writing to request a comprehensive legal review of our AI-assisted clinical supervision system called **MAIA** (Multi-framework AI for Integration and Analysis) before launching a beta program with licensed mental health practitioners.

## What We're Asking You to Review

This package contains:

1. **This cover letter** - Overview and specific questions
2. **System Overview for Legal** - 2-page executive summary of MAIA
3. **Sample Consent Forms** - Three versions (adult, minor, forensic)
4. **Privacy & Security Architecture** - Technical compliance overview
5. **Priority Legal Questions** - 10 specific areas needing your guidance
6. **Full Master Documentation** - Complete 35,000-word practitioner guide (MAIA_Supervisory_Colleague_MASTER_v1.0.md)

## Background

**MAIA's Purpose**: AI tool that supports licensed therapists by analyzing session recordings and providing supervision-style feedback. MAIA does NOT:
- Provide therapy directly to clients
- Make diagnostic determinations
- Replace human supervision
- Override practitioner clinical judgment

**MAIA's Function**: Second-opinion colleague for practitioners, like having a supervisor behind a one-way mirror.

## Our Legal Posture

We want to launch MAIA **defensively and ethically**:

✅ **What we've done**:
- Designed explicit informed consent protocols (3-tier system)
- Built HIPAA-compliant architecture (end-to-end encryption, BAA)
- Documented known limitations and biases extensively
- Positioned MAIA as "decision support tool" not "clinical decision-maker"
- Required human supervision to continue alongside MAIA use

❓ **What we need your help with**:
- Validating our consent language is legally sufficient
- Understanding liability allocation (practitioner vs. MAIA vs. developer)
- Ensuring HIPAA/state privacy law compliance
- Reviewing mandated reporting protocols
- Addressing malpractice insurance implications
- Evaluating intellectual property considerations
- Assessing FDA/regulatory requirements (if any)

## Timeline

We aim to launch **beta testing in 4-6 weeks** with 10-15 practitioners. We need your review within **2-3 weeks** if possible to stay on schedule.

## Scope of Engagement

We request:

### Phase 1: Document Review (Priority)
- Review all materials in this package
- Provide written assessment of legal risks and required modifications
- Answer the 10 priority questions (see Priority_Legal_Questions.md)
- Recommend changes to consent forms and practitioner agreements
- **Estimated time**: 8-12 hours

### Phase 2: Agreement Drafting (if needed)
- Draft practitioner license/service agreement
- Draft Business Associate Agreement (HIPAA)
- Draft Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for platform
- **Estimated time**: 6-10 hours

### Phase 3: Ongoing Advisory (optional)
- Availability for questions during beta period
- Review of any incident reports or edge cases
- **Estimated time**: As needed, hourly

## Budget

Please provide:
1. **Flat fee quote** for Phase 1 (document review)
2. **Hourly rate** for Phase 2 and 3 work
3. **Estimated total cost** for all three phases

We are a small research collective with limited funding. If costs exceed our budget, we may need to phase the work or prioritize only critical items.

## Key Concerns (Preview)

Based on our research, we anticipate you'll focus on:

1. **Liability**: If MAIA misses a suicidal ideation flag and practitioner also misses it, who is liable?
2. **Consent adequacy**: Is our 3-tier consent model sufficient? Do we need separate consent for minors?
3. **HIPAA**: Are our technical safeguards and BAA structure compliant?
4. **Mandated reporting**: Does MAIA's flagging of abuse create additional practitioner obligations?
5. **FDA regulation**: Is MAIA a "medical device" requiring FDA clearance?
6. **Algorithmic bias**: What's our exposure if MAIA demonstrably performs worse for certain demographics?
7. **IP protection**: How do we protect our proprietary models while being transparent about limitations?
8. **Forensic use prohibition**: How do we enforce our ban on MAIA use in custody/legal cases?
9. **State licensing**: Do we need to be licensed in each state where practitioners use MAIA?
10. **Insurance requirements**: Should we require practitioners to have specific malpractice coverage?

## Confidentiality

All materials provided are **confidential and proprietary**. We request:
- Attorney-client privilege for all communications
- Non-disclosure of MAIA's technical specifications
- Secure storage/destruction of review materials per your firm's policy

## Next Steps

**Please confirm**:
1. Availability to take on this engagement
2. Estimated timeline for Phase 1 review
3. Fee structure
4. Any conflicts of interest

We're available for a **30-minute intake call** at your convenience to discuss the project in detail.
