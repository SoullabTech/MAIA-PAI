## Three Paths Forward

Based on your scope of practice, choose your track:

### Path A: Licensed Therapist (Clinical Track)

**Your context**:
- You're a licensed mental health professional (LMFT, LCSW, PsyD, PhD, etc.)
- You provide therapy/psychotherapy
- You're subject to HIPAA, licensing boards, professional ethics codes

**What you need**:
- ✅ HIPAA-compliant setup
- ✅ Malpractice insurance
- ✅ Human clinical supervision
- ✅ Full informed consent process
- ✅ Crisis protocols

**Your documents**:
- Use clinical language in consent form ("therapy," "clinical supervision")
- Include HIPAA privacy notices
- Coordinate with your clinical supervisor

**Timeline**: May take longer due to compliance requirements

---

### Path B: Coach/Healer (Wellness Track)

**Your context**:
- You're a life coach, spiritual guide, somatic practitioner, etc.
- You do NOT provide therapy or treat mental health conditions
- You're NOT subject to HIPAA (but still need privacy protections)

**What you need**:
- ✅ Clear scope disclaimers ("not therapy")
- ✅ Privacy policy (not HIPAA-level, but still strong)
- ✅ Crisis referral protocols
- ✅ Professional liability insurance (recommended)
- ✅ Referral network to licensed therapists

**Your documents**:
- Use wellness language in consent form ("coaching," "transformation support")
- Add disclaimers about mental health treatment
- Emphasize referral pathways

**Timeline**: Faster to launch (fewer compliance hurdles)

---

### Path C: Both (Hybrid)

**Your context**:
- You're licensed AND offer coaching/wellness services
- You wear different hats with different clients

**What you need**:
- ✅ Clear designation for each client (therapist hat vs. coach hat)
- ✅ Two versions of consent forms (clinical vs. wellness)
- ✅ Documentation of which services you're providing to whom

**Your approach**:
- With therapy clients → Clinical track
- With coaching clients → Wellness track
- NEVER blur the lines (insurance fraud risk)
