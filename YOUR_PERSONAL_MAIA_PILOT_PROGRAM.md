**Setting**: End of our existing session or start of next one

**My script**:
"[Client name], I want to tell you about a new tool I'm experimenting
with in my practice. It's called MAIA, and it's an AI system that helps
me be a better [therapist/coach] by analyzing our sessions and showing
me patterns I might miss.

Here's how it works: [2-3 sentences in your words]

Your privacy is protected: [1-2 sentences on security]

You have complete choice: [Emphasize they can decline]

What questions do you have?"

**Common questions I anticipate**:

## Week 2: Client Selection & Consent

### Task 1: Select Pilot Clients (3-5 recommended)

**Ideal pilot client characteristics**:
- ✅ Existing client (established trust)
- ✅ Stable enough to handle new process
- ✅ Curious/open-minded about technology
- ✅ Good communicator (will give you honest feedback)
- ✅ NOT in acute crisis

**Avoid for pilot**:
- ❌ New intake clients (too many variables)
- ❌ Highly anxious about privacy/AI
- ❌ Acute crisis or severe symptoms
- ❌ Clients you're struggling with (add complexity)

**Your pilot client list**:

1. **Client A** (initials only for privacy):
   - Why good fit: [e.g., "Stable, tech-savvy, great communicator"]
   - Current focus: [e.g., "Career transition, Nigredo stage"]
   - Predicted reaction: [e.g., "Will be curious and say yes"]

2. **Client B**:
   - Why good fit:
   - Current focus:
   - Predicted reaction:

3. **Client C**:
   - Why good fit:
   - Current focus:
   - Predicted reaction:

4. **Client D** (optional):
5. **Client E** (optional):

### Task 2: Obtain Informed Consent

**Process**:

1. **Introduce at end of current session** (or start of next):
   - Use your rehearsed script
   - Allow 10-15 minutes for questions
   - Don't rush

2. **Provide written materials**:
   - Hand them the consent form to review
   - Offer to email it so they can review at home
   - "Take your time, we can discuss next session"

3. **Answer questions honestly**:
   - Use the FAQ you prepared
   - Admit what you don't know yet ("This is new for me too")
   - Emphasize their choice and right to decline

4. **Document response**:
   ```
   Client [initial]: MAIA consent discussed [date]
   Questions asked: [list]
   Decision: ☐ Consented  ☐ Declined  ☐ Wants to think about it
   Notes: [any concerns, how you addressed them]
   ```

5. **Get signature** (digital or physical):
   - Have them sign consent form
   - Give them a copy
   - File yours securely

**Track consent outcomes**:
- Consented: _____ / 5
- Declined: _____ / 5
- Still deciding: _____ / 5

**If client declines**:
- [ ] Thank them for honesty
- [ ] Reassure: "No impact on our work together"
- [ ] Ask (if they're willing): "Can you share what made you decline? Helps me improve."
- [ ] Document their feedback

### Task 3: Set Expectations with Pilot Clients

**What to tell clients who consent**:

"Thank you for being willing to try this with me. Since this is new, here's what to expect:

**During sessions**:
- I might have my laptop open more than usual (glancing at MAIA dashboard)
- If it feels distracting, tell me immediately and I'll close it
- The session will still be about YOU, not the technology

**After sessions**:
- MAIA will analyze our conversation and give me a report
- I'll review it between sessions
- If there's anything useful for you, I'll bring it up next time

**Your role**:
- Just be yourself—don't perform for the AI
- Give me feedback: Is this helping? Hurting? Neutral?
- If it ever feels weird, say so

**My commitment**:
- Your experience comes first, technology second
- If MAIA interferes with our work, I'll stop using it
- I'll check in with you regularly about how this is going

Sound good?"

### Week 2 Deliverables

- [ ] 3-5 pilot clients identified
- [ ] Consent conversations completed
- [ ] Signed consent forms filed
- [ ] Expectations set with consenting clients
- [ ] Feedback documented (even from those who declined)

---

## Weeks 3-6: Active Testing Phase

### Week 3: First Sessions with MAIA

**For each pilot client**:

**Pre-session**:
- [ ] Test recording setup (5 min before)
- [ ] Open MAIA dashboard, log in
- [ ] Set dashboard to "minimal view" (less distraction)
- [ ] Take 3 deep breaths, center yourself

**During session**:
- [ ] Start recording (confirm it's working)
- [ ] Engage with client as usual
- [ ] Glance at dashboard only during natural pauses:
  - When client is silent/reflecting
  - During transitions between topics
  - If you feel stuck and want a "second opinion"
- [ ] Note (mentally or on paper): When do you look? Why?

**Post-session**:
- [ ] Stop recording, upload to MAIA
- [ ] Wait for analysis (5-10 min processing time)
- [ ] Review MAIA report (plan 15-20 min)
- [ ] Take notes: What's accurate? What's off? What surprises you?

**Reflection questions** (answer after each session):

1. **Technical**: Any issues with recording, dashboard, analysis?
2. **Clinical**: Did MAIA catch something you missed? Disagree with something it flagged?
3. **Presence**: Were you distracted by the dashboard? By how much (1-10 scale)?
4. **Insights**: List 1-3 specific insights from MAIA report
5. **Next session**: What will you try differently because of MAIA's analysis?

**Track in spreadsheet**:

| Client | Date | Tech Issues? | Presence (1-10) | Key Insight | Will Try Next Session |
|--------|------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| A      | 1/28 | None        | 8 (minor)      | Missed transition to Albedo | Hold space for formlessness |
| B      | 1/29 | Audio cut out| 6 (distracting)| Coherence spike when I stayed silent | More silence |
| C      | 1/30 | None        | 9 (minimal)    | Self-attack pattern I hadn't named | IFS parts work |

### Week 4: Refining Dashboard Use

**Experiment**:
- **Session 1**: Dashboard on, glance freely
- **Session 2**: Dashboard off, rely on post-session report only
- **Session 3**: Dashboard on, but in "silent mode" (no alerts)
- **Session 4**: Dashboard on, alerts enabled

**Compare**:
- Which approach feels best for you?
- Which seems most effective for client?
- What's the right balance?

**Adjust settings**:
- [ ] Turn off distracting features
- [ ] Customize alert thresholds
- [ ] Choose which metrics to display

### Week 5: Testing Post-Session Reports

**Deep dive into report sections**:

After each session, rate each section of MAIA's report:

1. **Client Journey This Session**: Accurate? (1-5 stars)
2. **What You Did Well**: Meaningful? (1-5 stars)
3. **Moments for Reflection**: Useful? (1-5 stars)
4. **Framework Effectiveness**: Accurate ranking? (1-5 stars)
5. **Relational Dynamics**: On target? (1-5 stars)
6. **Trajectory & Next Session**: Helpful? (1-5 stars)

**Track**:
- Which sections are most valuable?
- Which feel like noise?
- What's missing that you wish was there?

**Action**:
- [ ] Email feedback to MAIA dev team weekly
- [ ] Request specific improvements
- [ ] Vote on feature priorities

### Week 6: Client Check-Ins

**Mid-pilot evaluation with each client**:

"We're about halfway through this experiment with MAIA. I want to check in:

1. Has anything felt different about our sessions since I started using it?
2. Better, worse, or neutral?
3. Is there anything you're curious about or concerned about?
4. Should I keep using it with you, or try something different?"

**Document responses**:

| Client | Noticed Difference? | Better/Worse/Neutral | Feedback | Continue? |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| A      | "You seem more focused" | Better | "Keep going" | Yes |
| B      | "No difference" | Neutral | "Fine either way" | Yes |
| C      | "You look at screen more" | Slightly worse | "Prefer eye contact" | Adjust (dashboard off) |

**Adjust based on feedback**:
- If client finds it distracting → Post-session analysis only
- If client is curious → Share selected insights
- If client is uncomfortable → Stop using for that client

---

## What If Things Don't Go Well?

**Possible outcomes**:

1. **MAIA is transformative** → Proceed to practitioner beta with enthusiasm

2. **MAIA is helpful but needs work** → Continue using, prioritize critical fixes, slower rollout

3. **MAIA is neutral** → Evaluate ROI, maybe it's just not worth the effort/cost

4. **MAIA interferes with your work** → Pause, go back to drawing board, fundamentally rethink

**All outcomes are valuable**. This is why you pilot!

Better to learn with 5 clients than 500 practitioners.
