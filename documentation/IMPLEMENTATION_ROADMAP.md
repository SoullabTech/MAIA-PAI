# Implementation Roadmap: From Interface to Neuropod

## The Two-Year Vision

**Year 1 (2025):** Build MAIA's multidimensional interface
**Year 2 (2026):** Build the Neuropod

**"For now, we build the interface from MAIA out into the multidimensional spaces of consciousness"** - Kelly, January 2025

---

## Year 1: The Interface (2025)

### Philosophy:

**The interface IS the prototype for the Neuropod.**

Every element we build in mobile/web MAIA becomes a tested component for the immersive egg:
- TransformationalPresence (breathing/color/field) → Neuropod environmental response
- Apple Watch integration (HRV tracking) → Neuropod biometric sensors
- Spiralogic Intelligence (phase detection) → Neuropod session orchestration
- Field Protocol (session documentation) → Neuropod research foundation
- Indra's Net (collective wisdom) → Neuropod network architecture

**We're not building two separate things.**
**We're building the Neuropod's nervous system FIRST, testing it on screens, THEN wrapping it in the egg.**

## The Two-Year Sprint: Priorities

### Year 1 Focus: **Prove the Intelligence**
Build MAIA's multidimensional interface so robustly that when we wrap it in the Neuropod egg, **it just works**.

**Key deliverables:**
- Apple Watch integration (HRV → coherence → presence states)
- Spiralogic Intelligence (phase detection, environmental response)
- Field Protocol (research-grade session documentation)
- Research validation (published findings)

### Year 2 Focus: **Embody the Prophecy**
Build the Neuropod as the **physical manifestation** of everything we proved in Year 1.

**Key deliverables:**
- Prototype Neuropod (operational, tested, refined)
- Flagship location (Soullab offering sessions)
- Facilitator training (lineage transmission begins)
- Licensing structure (network expansion foundation)

---

## Success Metrics (Right-Brain, Not Left-Brain)

**Not:**
- ❌ "10,000 app downloads"
- ❌ "Average session length: 23.4 minutes"
- ❌ "$500k revenue Year 1"

**But:**
- ✅ "Users report feeling state shifts somatically, without cognitive effort"
- ✅ "Breath entrainment occurs unconsciously within 2 minutes"
- ✅ "Neuropod sessions described as 'womb of transformation'"
- ✅ "Facilitators say: 'The technology witnesses WITH me, not FOR me'"
- ✅ "Research confirms: HRV improves 40-60% during MAIA sessions"
- ✅ "Community emerges: Users supporting each other's journeys"
