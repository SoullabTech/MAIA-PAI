# Demon Detection: Language Pattern Recognition

**Purpose**: Recognize shadow patterns through language, NOT to manipulate, but to **see and reflect back** what the reader may not yet see in themselves.

**Ethics**: All detection is transparent. Readers can ask "What are you noticing?" and receive honest answers.

---

## Core Principle

**We're not profiling. We're listening.**

The system tracks language patterns to:
1. Recognize developmental phase
2. Detect shadow material
3. Assess readiness for movement
4. **Show readers their own patterns** when asked

## Detection Algorithm

```typescript
interface DemonDetection {
  demon: string;           // e.g., 'fire_1_refusal'
  confidence: number;      // 0-1
  evidence: string[];      // Actual quotes/keywords found
  phase_suggestion: string; // e.g., 'Fire 1'
  supportive_prompt: string; // What to offer
}

function detectDemons(userText: string, conversationHistory: string[]): DemonDetection[] {
  const detections: DemonDetection[] = [];

  // For each demon pattern
  for (const pattern of demonPatterns) {
    const matches = findKeywords(userText, pattern.keywords);

    if (matches.length >= pattern.threshold) {
      detections.push({
        demon: pattern.name,
        confidence: matches.length / pattern.keywords.length,
        evidence: matches,
        phase_suggestion: pattern.phase,
        supportive_prompt: pattern.reflection_prompt
      });
    }
  }

  // Check conversation history for persistent patterns
  const historicalMatches = analyzeHistory(conversationHistory);

  return detections.sort((a, b) => b.confidence - a.confidence);
}

## Transparency Protocol

### When Reader Asks: "What are you noticing?"

**MAIA Response Template**:

> Based on what you've shared, I'm noticing a few patterns:
>
> **Language I'm hearing**:
> - [Specific quotes]
>
> **What this might indicate**:
> - You may be in [Phase] of [Element]
> - I'm sensing [demon name, explained compassionately]
>
> **Why I think this**:
> - [Keywords/phrases that triggered detection]
>
> **What this tells me about what you might need**:
> - [Supportive response]
>
> **Does this resonate? Or am I missing something?**

### Example:

> Based on what you've shared, I'm noticing a few patterns:
>
> **Language I'm hearing**:
> - "I've done enough"
> - "Why can't they accept who I am?"
> - "Hell no to this call"
>
> **What this might indicate**:
> - You may be in **Fire 1** (Vision & Refusal)
> - I'm sensing what we call **Refusal of the Call** - not as failure, but as a legitimate pause or a protective response to past wounds
>
> **Why I think this**:
> - Your language has that "I'm tired of being asked for more" quality
> - There's a sense of having given a lot and needing rest
> - Or possibly, past experiences where saying yes led to pain
>
> **What this tells me about what you might need**:
> - Permission to refuse if that's true
> - Space to discern: Is this "not yet" or "not this way" or "I need rest first"?
> - Practices that don't push, but hold
>
> **Does this resonate? Or am I missing something?**

## Ethical Boundaries

### What We DON'T Do

❌ **Use detection to manipulate**
❌ **Label without permission**
❌ **Assume we're right**
❌ **Hide what we're seeing**

### What We DO

✅ **Reflect patterns back for exploration**
✅ **Ask permission before naming shadows**
✅ **Hold our interpretations lightly**
✅ **Make all detection transparent on request**

---

## Integration with Reflection Prompts

When demons detected, offer corresponding prompts from REFLECTION-PROMPTS-BY-PHASE.md:

```typescript
if (detected.includes('fire_1_refusal')) {
  offerPrompts([
    "What if refusing the call right now is exactly right?",
    "What does this vision want FROM you vs. TO GIVE you?"
  ]);
}

if (detected.includes('water_1_flooding')) {
  offerPrompts([
    "You can touch the edge of this feeling without diving all the way in. What's at the edge?",
    "What boundary would let you feel more deeply while staying resourced?"
  ]);
}
```

---

## Meta-View Integration

When reader asks: **"Where am I in the map?"**

Show them:
1. Detected phase
2. Evidence (their actual language)
3. Associated demons (compassionately named)
4. Where they've been (progression through phases)
5. Where they might be heading (next phase indicators)
6. **Most importantly**: "This is what I'm seeing - does it match what you're experiencing?"
