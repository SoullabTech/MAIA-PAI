# Reflection Prompts by Elemental Phase

**Purpose**: Help readers feel SEEN, not projected onto. Each prompt is calibrated to the specific demons, gifts, and recalibration needs of that developmental phase.

---

## How to Use This

### For Practitioners
- Select prompts based on where you sense the reader is
- Mix diagnostic (revealing) and supportive (holding) prompts
- Watch for language patterns in responses

### For MAIA Integration
- Offer 2-3 prompts after each section
- Track which prompts they engage with (reveals phase resonance)
- Analyze response text for demon/readiness indicators
- Adapt future prompts based on engagement patterns

## Implementation in MAIA

### Prompt Selection Algorithm

```typescript
function selectPrompts(phase: ElementalPhase, sessionHistory: Session[]): Prompt[] {
  // Mix diagnostic, supportive, recalibration based on:
  // 1. Current phase
  // 2. Engagement patterns (which they've answered before)
  // 3. Detected demons (from keyword analysis)
  // 4. Readiness signals (from recent responses)

  const prompts = []

  // Always include 1 open prompt
  prompts.push(selectRandom(metaPrompts))

  // Add 1 diagnostic if we're uncertain about phase
  if (phaseConfidence < 0.7) {
    prompts.push(diagnosticPrompts[phase])
  }

  // Add 1 supportive if demons detected
  if (demonsDetected.length > 0) {
    prompts.push(supportivePrompts[phase])
  }

  // Add recalibration if showing readiness
  if (readinessSignals.includes('movement_toward_next_phase')) {
    prompts.push(recalibrationPrompts[phase])
  }

  return prompts.slice(0, 3) // Max 3 prompts per check-in
}
```

### Response Analysis

Track:
- **Engagement** (did they answer?)
- **Depth** (1 sentence vs. paragraph vs. raw emotion)
- **Keywords** (demon indicators, readiness signals)
- **Patterns** (do they always skip supportive prompts = resistance to being held?)
