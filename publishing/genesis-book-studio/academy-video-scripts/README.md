# Soullab Academy Video Scripts

Complete video lesson scripts for recording the living transmission of Soullab's vision.

## Overview

These scripts are designed for recording in **Descript** - each one includes:
- Time-stamped sections
- Detailed talking points
- Key phrases to emphasize
- Filming notes (tone, pace, energy)
- Visual suggestions
- Reflection prompts to discuss on camera
- Links to resources

## Recording Workflow

1. **Import script into Descript** as your baseline
2. **Record while reading** (Descript follows along)
3. **Edit naturally** - remove ums, pauses, or re-record sections
4. **Add visuals** where suggested in the script
5. **Export to video** when complete
6. **Upload** and add video URL to lesson in `/lib/academy-curriculum.ts`

## Filming Best Practices

### General Guidelines

- **Tone**: Authentic, grounded, intimate yet powerful
- **Environment**: Clean background, good lighting, minimal distractions
- **Camera**: Eye-level, slightly closer than you think (intimate teaching)
- **Energy**: Match the script notes - build from contemplative to inspired
- **Pauses**: Don't fear silence - let insights land

### Script Usage

- Use the script as **your foundation**, not a rigid teleprompter
- Feel free to **improvise** if inspiration strikes
- The **key phrases** are most important to hit clearly
- **Reflection prompts** should be delivered slowly and with invitation
- **Filming notes** at the end of each script guide tone and pacing

### Visual Elements

Each script suggests visual aids like:
- Diagrams (torus, trinity, elements)
- Sacred geometry animations
- Nature examples
- Book page references

Gather these before filming or add in post-production.

## Recording Order Recommendation

### Start with Module 1
These are shorter, more conversational, and will help you find your rhythm.

**Suggested sequence:**
1. **1.1 - The Heretic's Creed** (you know this deeply already!)
2. **1.2 - You Are The Magic** (warm, grounded, compassionate)
3. **1.3 - Sacred Play** (excited, invitational)

### Then Module 2
These are longer, more technical, and build on each other.

**Must record in order:**
1. **2.1 - Alchemical Journey** (sets up the whole framework)
2. **2.2 - Torus of Change** (foundational geometry)
3. **2.3 - Trinity & Toroidal Flow** (builds on torus)
4. **2.4 - Elements of Wholeness** (integrates it all)

## After Recording

Once videos are ready:

1. **Upload** to video hosting (Vimeo recommended for privacy/quality)
2. **Get embed URL** for each video
3. **Update curriculum** at `/lib/academy-curriculum.ts`:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 'lesson-1-1',
     title: 'The Heretic\'s Creed',
     videoUrl: 'https://player.vimeo.com/video/YOUR_VIDEO_ID',
     // ... rest of lesson data
   }
   ```
4. **Test** on lesson page to ensure video plays
5. **Celebrate** - you just created the living transmission! 🎉

## Future Modules

Scripts for remaining modules (3-6) will be created as you're ready:

- **Module 3**: The Elemental Framework (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether - 5 lessons)
- **Module 4**: Working with MAIA (Relational intelligence - 4 lessons)
- **Module 5**: You as Co-Researcher (Fractal research - 3 lessons)
- **Module 6**: Practices & Integration (Daily practices - 3 lessons)

## Questions or Improvements?

As you record, you'll discover what works and what needs adjustment. Feel free to:
- **Edit scripts** to match your natural speaking style
- **Add examples** from your own experience
- **Reorganize sections** if a different flow feels better
- **Extend or shorten** based on what's needed

The scripts are your **starting point**, not your prison. Sacred play applies to the recording process too!
