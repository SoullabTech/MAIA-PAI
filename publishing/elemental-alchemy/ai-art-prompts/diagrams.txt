## Hemispheric Brain Functions

Split brain diagram showing left and right hemispheres with elemental correspondences: LEFT SIDE showing Air (prefrontal cortex/logic) and Earth (left hemisphere/practical organization), RIGHT SIDE showing Fire (right prefrontal/creativity) and Water (right hemisphere/emotions), connections and integration between all parts, clean medical illustration style but with sacred geometry overlays, educational and clear --ar 16:9 --style raw

## The Web of Life / Interconnection

Glowing network of nodes and connections forming web pattern, each node representing a being or consciousness point, connections between all points showing interdependence, fractal self-similarity (small webs within larger web), cosmic scale showing how all life is interconnected, emerald and gold light on deep purple space background, mystical network visualization --ar 16:9 --v 6

## Transformation Cycles

Circular diagram showing continuous cycle: Encountering Challenges → Gaining Insights → Integrating Wisdom → Refinement/Growth → (repeat), arrows showing clockwise flow, four seasons or phases marked, spiral overlay showing how each cycle elevates consciousness, educational but beautiful --ar 1:1 --style raw
