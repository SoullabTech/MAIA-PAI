## 📖 Print Book → Platform Integration

### Strategy: Minimal, Powerful QR Codes

**Placement**: One subtle QR code per chapter (in wide left margin)

```

```
[MAIA voice - warm, present]
"Welcome to the Fire chapter. Before we begin,
 take a moment to notice... where do you feel
 fire energy in your body right now?

 [5-second pause]

 Good. Let's explore together."

[Narrator voice - professional, clear]
"Chapter Five: Fire - The Sacred Flame

 In the primordial dawn before time's first
 breath, a brilliant spark leapt forth..."

 [Continues for 3-4 minutes]

[MAIA voice - inviting]
"Let's pause here. You've just encountered
 the concept of calcinatio - the burning away
 of what's false.

 I invite you to close your eyes and feel...
 what in your life is ready to burn away?

 [20-second pause with subtle background tone]

 When you're ready, we'll continue."

[Narrator continues...]

[At practice section]

[MAIA voice]
"Here's a practice from the book. Would you
 like to try it now with my guidance, or
 continue listening and come back to it later?

 For guided practice, we'll pause the audiobook
 and I'll lead you through. For continuous
 listening, we'll summarize and move on.

 [Tap screen or say 'Practice now' or 'Continue']"

[If user chooses practice:]
[MAIA guides through 5-minute fire meditation]
[Then returns to narration]

[At end of chapter]

[MAIA voice]
"Beautiful. You've completed the Fire chapter.

 If you'd like to deepen this work:
 • Visit your Fire Journey map on Genesis
 • Connect with the Fire Circle community
 • Try the 7-day Fire transformation practice

 Or, continue to the next chapter: Water.

 What would you like to do?"
