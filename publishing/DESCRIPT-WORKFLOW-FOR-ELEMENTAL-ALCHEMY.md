# Descript Workflow for Elemental Alchemy Audiobook
## Step-by-Step Guide for Kelly Nezat

**Purpose:** Practical, detailed instructions for using Descript to record, edit, and export the Elemental Alchemy audiobook.

**Assumption:** You have Descript installed and a basic microphone setup ready.

---

## Part 1: Initial Setup (Do This Once)

### Step 1: Create New Project

1. **Open Descript**
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Name it: **"Elemental Alchemy - Audiobook Master"**
4. Choose location: Save to a folder you'll remember (Desktop or Documents)
5. Click **Create**

### Step 2: Configure Audio Settings

1. In your new project, click **Descript** menu → **Preferences**
2. Go to **Recording** tab
3. Set these options:
   - **Input Device:** Select your USB microphone (Blue Yeti, Shure MV7, etc.)
   - **Sample Rate:** 48000 Hz
   - **Channels:** Mono (voice-only audiobooks should be mono)
   - **File Format:** WAV
4. Test your microphone:
   - Speak normally
   - Watch the input level meter
   - Green is good, yellow is okay, red is too loud
   - Adjust input gain on your microphone if needed (aim for green with occasional yellow peaks)

### Step 3: Create Folder Structure

Descript uses "Compositions" (individual recording files) organized in folders.

**Create these folders:**

1. In the left sidebar, right-click in the project area → **New Folder**
2. Create:
   - **📁 00 - Front Matter** (Dedication, Acknowledgments, AI Statement)
   - **📁 01 - Introduction**
   - **📁 02 - Fire Chapters** (Chapters 1-3)
   - **📁 03 - Water Chapters** (Chapters 4-6)
   - **📁 04 - Earth Chapters** (Chapters 7-9)
   - **📁 05 - Air Chapters** (Chapters 10-12)
   - **📁 06 - Aether Chapters** (Chapters 13-15)
   - **📁 07 - Conclusion**
   - **📁 08 - Appendices**
   - **📁 09 - Audio Branding** (Opening/closing sequences)

**Tip:** The "00, 01, 02" numbering keeps folders in order.

### Step 4: Create Audio Branding Compositions

Before recording chapters, record your opening and closing sequences once. You'll reuse these for consistency.

**Opening Sequence:**

1. Right-click **📁 09 - Audio Branding** folder → **New Composition**
2. Name it: **"Opening Credits"**
3. Click the big red **Record** button
4. Record:
   ```
   [3 seconds silence]

   Elemental Alchemy: The Spiralogic Process for Embodied Consciousness.

   Written and narrated by Kelly Nezat.

   In collaboration with Claude Code and the MAIA-PAI Oracle System.

   [2 seconds silence]
   ```
5. Click **Stop** (or press Command+Shift+2)
6. Descript will transcribe automatically

**Closing Sequence:**

1. Same process, create composition: **"Closing Credits"**
2. Record:
   ```
   [3 seconds silence]

   Thank you for journeying through Elemental Alchemy with me.

   May this wisdom serve your awakening.

   I am because we are.

   [3 seconds silence]
   ```

**Now you have reusable branding elements!**

## Part 2: Recording Your First Chapter

### Step 1: Prepare Your Manuscript

**Before you start recording:**

1. Have the chapter text open on a second screen (or printed)
2. Read through it once silently
3. Note any difficult words or names to look up pronunciation
4. Mark natural pause points (end of sections, major concepts)

### Step 2: Create Chapter Composition

1. Right-click the appropriate folder (e.g., **📁 01 - Introduction**)
2. Select **New Composition**
3. Name it clearly: **"Chapter 00 - Introduction"**
   - Use 00, 01, 02 numbering so they stay in order
4. Double-click to open the composition

### Step 3: Record the Chapter

**Recording Process:**

1. **Put on your headphones** (so you can monitor your voice)
2. **Check your mic level** (speak normally, watch the meter—green is perfect)
3. **Take a breath, ground yourself**
4. Click the **red Record button** (or press **Command+Shift+2**)
5. **3 seconds silence** (gives you editing room)
6. **Announce chapter:** "Chapter One: [Chapter Title]"
7. **2 seconds pause**
8. **Begin narrating the chapter**

**While Recording:**

- **If you make a mistake:**
  - Don't stop recording!
  - Pause for 2 seconds
  - Re-read the sentence correctly
  - Continue
  - (You'll edit out the mistake later—MUCH easier than starting over)

- **If you lose your place:**
  - Pause for 2 seconds
  - Say "edit point" or clap once (makes a visual spike in the waveform)
  - Back up a sentence and continue

- **If you need a break:**
  - Click **Pause** (or press Command+Shift+2)
  - Take your break
  - Click **Resume** when ready
  - (Descript will keep it all in one file)

**End of Chapter:**

1. **3 seconds silence**
2. Click **Stop Recording**

Descript will now **transcribe your audio automatically**. This takes a minute or two.

### Step 4: Edit Out Mistakes

This is where Descript SHINES—editing audio is as easy as editing a text document.

**Basic Editing:**

1. **Find the mistake in the transcript** (much easier than scrubbing through audio)
2. **Select the wrong words** (click and drag, just like in Word)
3. **Press Delete**
4. The audio is deleted too!

**Example:**

Your transcript shows:
```
"The fire element represents... uh... represents passion and transformation."
```

Select "represents... uh..." → Delete

Now it reads:
```
"The fire element represents passion and transformation."
```

And the audio matches perfectly!

**Common Edits:**

- **Remove filler words:** um, uh, like, you know
- **Remove false starts:** "The—The fire element"
- **Remove mouth clicks:** Just select the little click sound and delete
- **Add pauses:** Click where you want a pause, press Enter (adds 1 second), or type "..." and it becomes a pause

### Step 5: Apply Studio Sound

Descript has an AI feature called **Studio Sound** that removes background noise and normalizes your audio.

**To apply:**

1. Select all text (Command+A)
2. In the right panel, find **Studio Sound**
3. Toggle it **ON**
4. Adjust the slider:
   - **Left (less):** More natural, keeps some room tone
   - **Right (more):** Maximum noise removal, very clean
   - **Recommended:** Start at 50%, adjust to taste
5. Click **Apply**

**Your audio now sounds professional studio quality!**

### Step 6: Listen Through & Refine

1. Click at the beginning of the composition
2. Press **Spacebar** to play
3. Listen for:
   - Pacing issues (too fast/slow)
   - Awkward cuts (from your edits)
   - Volume inconsistencies
4. Make adjustments:
   - **Add pauses:** Press Enter or type "..."
   - **Smooth transitions:** Select audio around an edit, right-click → **Smooth Audio** (adds crossfade)
   - **Adjust volume:** Select section, use volume slider in right panel

## Part 3: Workflow for Remaining Chapters

### Efficient Recording Strategy

**Option A: Record Multiple Chapters in One Session**

1. Create all compositions for the session (e.g., Chapters 1, 2, 3)
2. Record Chapter 1 → Stop → Save
3. Open Chapter 2 composition → Record → Stop → Save
4. Open Chapter 3 composition → Record → Stop → Save
5. Edit all three later when you're fresh

**Option B: Record & Edit Immediately**

1. Record Chapter 1
2. Edit Chapter 1 while listening is fresh
3. Take a break
4. Record Chapter 2
5. Edit Chapter 2

**Recommended:** Option A for recording (batch similar tasks), but edit within 24 hours while memory is fresh.

### Template for Chapter Workflow

For each chapter:

1. ✅ Create composition with clear name
2. ✅ Record chapter (don't worry about mistakes)
3. ✅ Let Descript transcribe
4. ✅ Edit out mistakes via transcript
5. ✅ Apply Studio Sound
6. ✅ Listen through for flow
7. ✅ Export to backup drive (see Part 4)
8. ✅ Move to next chapter

## Part 4: Exporting & Backup

### Export Individual Chapter (for backup)

After editing each chapter:

1. Open the composition
2. **File** → **Export** → **Audio**
3. Settings:
   - **Format:** WAV (master files) or MP3 (compressed)
   - **Quality:** Highest (WAV) or 192 kbps (MP3)
   - **Channels:** Mono
4. **Save to external backup drive**

**File naming:**
```
EA_Chapter_01_Fire_Awakening.wav
```

### Export Entire Audiobook (when complete)

**For Audible/ACX submission:**

1. Each chapter must be a separate MP3 file
2. Export one chapter at a time:
   - Open composition → Export → MP3, 192 kbps, Mono
3. Name files in order:
   ```
   01_Opening_Credits.mp3
   02_Introduction.mp3
   03_Chapter_01.mp3
   04_Chapter_02.mp3
   ...
   ```

**For Genesis Platform / Personal Distribution:**

You can create a **single M4B audiobook file** with embedded chapters:

1. **File** → **Export** → **Video** (yes, video—but it will be audio-only)
2. Select **Audio Only**
3. Format: **M4A** (which becomes M4B for audiobooks)
4. Chapters: **Use Compositions as Chapters** (check this box!)
5. Export

**Result:** One file (e.g., `Elemental_Alchemy_Complete.m4b`) with chapters that listeners can skip between.

## Part 5: Advanced Descript Features for Audiobooks

### Overdub (AI Voice Cloning)

Descript can create an AI clone of your voice. This is useful if:

- You need to fix a sentence but don't want to re-record
- You forgot a word and want to insert it seamlessly

**How it works:**

1. Record at least 10 minutes of your voice (Descript will prompt you)
2. Descript creates "Kelly's Voice" AI model
3. You can TYPE a correction and it speaks in your voice
4. Use sparingly—your real voice is better, but this is great for tiny fixes

**To create your Overdub:**

1. **Descript** menu → **Preferences** → **Overdub**
2. Click **Create Overdub Voice**
3. Follow prompts (read provided script for 10 minutes)
4. Wait 10-15 minutes for processing

**To use Overdub:**

1. In transcript, type new words you want to insert
2. Select the typed words
3. Right-click → **Generate Overdub**
4. The words now play in your AI voice

**Example use case:**

You recorded: "The fire element ignites transformation."

But you meant to say: "The fire element ignites CONSCIOUS transformation."

Just type "conscious" in the right spot → Generate Overdub → Done!

### Filler Word Removal (Automatic)

Descript can auto-detect and remove um, uh, like, you know, etc.

**To use:**

1. Select all text (Command+A)
2. **Edit** menu → **Remove Filler Words**
3. Descript highlights all filler words
4. Review them (sometimes "like" is used intentionally)
5. Click **Remove All** or delete individually

**Caution:** Don't overuse this—some verbal texture makes narration feel human. Remove obvious filler, but keep natural speech patterns.

### Word Replacement (Fix Mispronunciations)

If you consistently mispronounce a word:

1. **Edit** → **Find & Replace**
2. Find: [mispronounced word in transcript]
3. Record correct pronunciation once
4. Use Overdub to replace all instances

### Multitrack Recording (Optional)

If you want to add background music or soundscapes:

1. Import music file (drag into composition)
2. Descript creates a second track
3. Adjust volume of music track (much lower than voice—around -20 dB)
4. Music plays under your narration

**Recommended:** Keep audiobook voice-only for ACX compliance. Add music only for special Genesis Platform version if desired.

## Part 6: Quality Control Checklist

### Before Exporting Final Files

Go through this checklist for each chapter:

- [ ] **No filler words** (um, uh, like) unless intentional
- [ ] **No mouth clicks or pops** (select and delete them)
- [ ] **Consistent volume** (Studio Sound helps, but check manually)
- [ ] **Natural pacing** (not rushed, not dragging)
- [ ] **Clear pronunciation** (no mumbled words)
- [ ] **Appropriate pauses** (between sections, after key concepts)
- [ ] **Smooth transitions** (no jarring cuts from edits)
- [ ] **Chapter announcement** at start (clear and consistent across all chapters)
- [ ] **3-second silence** at start and end of each chapter (for clean editing)
- [ ] **Exported to backup drive** (don't lose your work!)

### ACX Audiobook Quality Requirements

If submitting to Audible, your files must pass these tests:

1. **Noise Floor:** Background noise must be below -60 dB
   - Studio Sound handles this
   - Record in a quiet room
2. **Peak Levels:** No audio should exceed -3 dB
   - Descript's limiter prevents clipping
3. **RMS (Average Loudness):** Should be between -18 dB and -23 dB
   - Studio Sound normalizes this
4. **Room Tone:** 0.5 to 1 second of silence at start/end of each file
   - Your 3-second silences cover this
5. **Retail Audio Sample:** First 1-5 minutes of audiobook (Introduction)
   - Make sure this is polished—it's what listeners preview!

**Descript automatically meets most of these requirements** if you use Studio Sound and record in a decent environment.

## Part 7: Troubleshooting

### "My voice sounds echoey"

**Problem:** Room has hard surfaces (walls, windows) bouncing sound.

**Solutions:**
- Record in a room with soft surfaces (bed, couch, rugs, curtains)
- Hang blankets on walls temporarily
- Use Studio Sound (reduces reverb)
- Record closer to mic (6-8 inches)

### "Descript isn't transcribing accurately"

**Problem:** Transcription AI doesn't recognize specialized terms (Spiralogic, Aether, shamanic terms).

**Solutions:**
- Add words to Descript's dictionary: **Edit** → **Add to Dictionary**
- Manually correct transcript (you can edit it like a text doc)
- The audio doesn't change—transcript is just for editing reference

### "I hear mouth clicks and saliva sounds"

**Problem:** Natural mouth sounds are amplified by close mic.

**Solutions:**
- Drink water before recording (stay hydrated)
- Avoid dairy before recording (causes excess mucus)
- Edit out clicks: select them in transcript/waveform → delete
- Move mic slightly off-axis (not directly in front of mouth)

### "My recordings are too quiet"

**Problem:** Input gain is too low.

**Solutions:**
- Increase gain on your microphone (physical knob on Blue Yeti, etc.)
- In Descript: Select audio → Right panel → Volume slider → Increase
- Use Studio Sound (normalizes levels)

### "My recordings are clipping (distorted)"

**Problem:** Input gain is too high.

**Solutions:**
- Decrease gain on your microphone
- Don't speak directly into mic (position at angle)
- Maintain 6-8 inches distance

### "Descript is running slowly"

**Problem:** Large project files can slow down performance.

**Solutions:**
- Export and archive completed chapters
- Close other applications while using Descript
- Restart Descript periodically
- Check storage space (audio files are large)

### "I deleted something I didn't mean to"

**Solution:** **Edit** → **Undo** (or Command+Z)

Descript has unlimited undo!

## Part 8: Time-Saving Tips

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn these—you'll save hours:

- **Command+Shift+2:** Start/Stop recording
- **Spacebar:** Play/Pause playback
- **Command+A:** Select all
- **Command+Z:** Undo
- **Command+C / Command+V:** Copy/Paste audio (yes, you can copy audio like text!)
- **Option+Delete:** Delete selected audio and close gap (smooth edit)
- **J / K / L:** Rewind / Pause / Fast-forward (like video editing)

### Batch Processing

**When editing multiple chapters:**

1. Open all chapter compositions in tabs
2. Apply Studio Sound to all:
   - Command+A (select all) in each
   - Turn on Studio Sound
   - Move to next tab
3. Export all at once: Select multiple compositions → Right-click → Export

### Templates

**Create a chapter template:**

1. Record a perfect chapter (announcement, pacing, silence at start/end)
2. **File** → **Duplicate Composition**
3. Delete the content (keep structure)
4. Use this as template for new chapters

### Script Markers

**While recording, add markers for later editing:**

- Clap once (creates visible spike in waveform) = "edit here"
- Say "bookmark" or "note to self" = reminder to fix something
- Leave long silence (3+ seconds) = easy to find in timeline
