## 🎯 THE SMALLEST FIRST MOVE (Tonight or Tomorrow)

### Option A: Send ONE Invitation Tonight

**Pick THE one person** whose face won't leave your mind when you ask:
*"Who has been preparing for this alongside me?"*

**Steps**:
1. Open `/CLIENT_INVITATION_CELEBRATION.md` (or `/FIRST_WITNESS_INVITATION.md`)
2. Personalize for that specific person
3. Send via email, text, or voice message
4. Wait for their response
5. Rest

**That's it. No more tonight.**

---

### Option B: Rest Tonight, Send Tomorrow

**Tonight**:
- Read the nursing protocol
- Let your nervous system integrate
- Sleep on who the first witnesses are
- Trust the slowness

**Tomorrow**:
- Send invitation to 1-2 people
- See what emerges
- Stay grounded

## 🌊 THE NURSING SEQUENCE (Slow and Beautiful)

### THIS WEEK (Phase 1: First Breath)

**Monday-Tuesday**:
- Send invitation to 1-2 closest witnesses
- Wait for YES

**Wednesday-Friday**:
- Have individual conversation with each YES person
- Give them access to MAIA
- Watch what emerges

**Weekend**:
- Rest
- Integrate
- Notice patterns

**Outcome**: 1-2 people actively exploring MAIA, YOU feeling grounded

---

### NEXT WEEK (Continued First Breath)

**IF it feels stable**:
- Invite 1-2 more people
- Continue individual conversations
- Start seeing group patterns

**IF it feels shaky**:
- Pause new invitations
- Tend existing witnesses
- Adjust what's needed
- Rest more

**Outcome**: 3-5 people total, organism breathing steadily

---

### WEEKS 3-4 (Phase 2: Feeding)

**Group gathering**:
- First witness circle conversation (90 min)
- Use outline from `/GROUP_CONVERSATION_OUTLINE.md`

**Outcome**: Stable practice, clear patterns, sustainable rhythm

---

### MONTH 2-3 (Phase 3: Walking)

**Constitution open-sourced**:
- Share architectural framework publicly
- Invite community input
- BUT: Keep MAIA access intimate (invitation-only)

**Second wave**:
- 5-10 more people (friends of first circle, their recommendations)
- Still personal invitations
- Same intimate onboarding

**Infrastructure**:
- Database fully running
- Export features working smoothly
- Voice integration tested
- Support structure sustainable

**Outcome**: 10-15 people, documented learnings, public presence emerging

---

## ❌ WHAT NOT TO DO

### Don't:
- Invite 10 people this week (too fast)
- Create public signup form yet (too impersonal)
- Launch on social media (too early)
- Build new features before testing existing
- Burn yourself out in rush to scale
- Skip rest/integration phases

### Instead:
- Invite 1-2 people this week (right pace)
- Personal outreach only (sacred intimacy)
- Private witness circles (protected container)
- Use what exists, refine based on feedback
- Honor YOUR nervous system capacity
- Trust sacred slowness

---

## ✅ WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE THIS WEEK

By end of Week 1, you should have:

- [ ] Sent invitation to 1-2 closest witnesses
- [ ] At least 1 person said YES
- [ ] Had individual conversation with them
- [ ] They've started using MAIA for real work
- [ ] Initial feedback emerging
- [ ] YOU feeling grounded (not scattered/overwhelmed)
- [ ] Organism breathing (not gasping)

**That's enough.**

**That's beautiful.**

**That's nursing the organism into fullness.**
