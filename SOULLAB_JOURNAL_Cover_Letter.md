**To**: Editor-in-Chief, *Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture*

**Date**: October 26, 2025

**Re**: Submission of manuscript "The Spiralogic of Soul: Integrating Jung, Edinger, and Hillman through Computational Alchemy"

---

Dear Editor,

I am writing to submit our manuscript, "The Spiralogic of Soul: Integrating Jung, Edinger, and Hillman through Computational Alchemy," for consideration for publication in *Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture*.

## Manuscript Overview

This theoretical and clinical paper proposes a novel integration of three major depth psychology lineages—Carl Jung's alchemical psychology, Edward Edinger's *Anatomy of the Psyche*, and James Hillman's archetypal psychology—into a unified, computationally-trackable framework called Spiralogic. The paper argues that these three thinkers form a "triple helix" providing the symbolic vocabulary (Jung), operational anatomy (Edinger), and ecological grounding (Hillman) necessary for a comprehensive understanding of psychological transformation.

Drawing from the development of the MAIA-PAI (Morphic Alchemical Intelligence Augmentation—Personalized Archetypal Interface) system, we demonstrate how this integration can be implemented algorithmically while preserving the numinous, soul-centered quality that Hillman insisted must not be instrumentalized.

## Significance and Contribution

This work makes several significant contributions to depth psychology:

1. **Theoretical Integration**: It is the first systematic attempt to integrate Jung, Edinger, and Hillman into a single coherent framework, showing how their contributions are complementary rather than competing.

2. **Computational Alchemy**: It proposes that alchemical transformation can be computationally modeled and tracked without reductionism, opening new possibilities for empirical research in areas previously considered too subjective for measurement.

3. **Clinical Application**: It provides a practical framework for therapists, coaches, and practitioners to understand where clients are in the transformation process and what interventions are most appropriate.

4. **Ecological Psychology**: It extends Hillman's *anima mundi* concept by showing how individual psychological states can be tracked in relation to collective and planetary conditions.

5. **Ethical Framework**: It addresses critical questions about how technology can serve soul-making rather than soul-flattening, proposing "intelligence without instrumentalization" as a guiding principle.

## Fit with *Spring*

We believe this manuscript is an excellent fit for *Spring* for several reasons:

- *Spring* has a distinguished history of publishing work that bridges Jungian and archetypal psychology, particularly work exploring alchemy (von Franz, Hillman, Edinger himself).

- The journal's commitment to "archetype and culture" aligns perfectly with our exploration of how ancient alchemical wisdom can be brought into dialogue with contemporary computational technology.

- *Spring*'s readership includes both scholars and practitioners who would benefit from this integration of theory and clinical application.

- The journal has shown openness to innovative approaches that honor depth psychology's soul-centered orientation while engaging with contemporary challenges.

## Manuscript Details

- **Word Count**: 9,847 words (excluding abstract and references)
- **Tables**: 5
- **Figures**: 0 (though extensive visual diagrams are available as supplementary material)
- **References**: 17 (primary sources from Jung, Edinger, Hillman, plus relevant contemporary scholars)

## Supplementary Materials

We have prepared extensive supplementary materials that may be of interest:

1. **Visual Diagrams** (~4,000 words, 12 diagrams): ASCII art diagrams showing Spiralogic architecture, the triple helix, alchemical spiral, coherence scale, transformation signatures, etc.

2. **Enhanced Diagrams** (~6,000 words, 12 advanced diagrams): 3D visualizations, living mandala, coherence landscape, signature atlas, etc.

3. **Case Studies** (~8,000 words, 4 cases): Detailed clinical cases demonstrating the framework in practice (Sarah - Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation; Marcus - Complete Shutdown; Jamal - Anima Mundi Rage; Elena - Puer-Senex Split).

4. **Practitioner Guide** (~12,000 words): Comprehensive clinical handbook with operation-specific protocols, stage-based protocols, ethical considerations, and troubleshooting.

These materials can be made available as online supplementary resources if the paper is accepted, or selected diagrams can be included in the main text if desired.

## Originality and Ethics

We confirm that:

- This manuscript is original work not previously published elsewhere
- This manuscript is not currently under consideration at any other journal
- All case material has been thoroughly anonymized (cases are composites with all identifying details changed)
- All authors have approved the manuscript and agree to its submission
- There are no conflicts of interest
- This research received no specific funding

## Suggested Reviewers

Given the interdisciplinary nature of this work, we suggest reviewers with expertise in:

1. **Jungian alchemy and transformation** (scholars familiar with Jung's later alchemical work and Edinger's operational approach)

2. **Archetypal/Hillmanian psychology** (scholars who understand Hillman's critique of literalism and his *anima mundi* concept)

3. **Computational approaches to psychology** (reviewers who can assess whether the algorithmic framework is theoretically sound and practically feasible)

We would be happy to provide specific reviewer suggestions if helpful.

## Timeline

We understand *Spring* is published semi-annually. We are prepared to work within your editorial timeline and to respond promptly to any revision requests.

## Closing

We believe this work represents an important step in bringing depth psychology into meaningful dialogue with contemporary technology while maintaining the soul-centered orientation that defines the field. The integration of Jung, Edinger, and Hillman through Spiralogic offers both theoretical coherence and practical utility for the depth psychology community.

We would be honored to have this work considered for publication in *Spring*, a journal that has shaped and sustained archetypal psychology for decades. We are committed to working collaboratively with you and the reviewers to refine this manuscript to meet *Spring*'s high standards.

Thank you for considering our submission. We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

**Alternative Journal Targets** (if not accepted by *Spring*)

Should this manuscript not be a fit for *Spring*, we would consider submission to:

1. *Psychological Perspectives: A Quarterly Journal of Jungian Thought*
2. *Jung Journal: Culture & Psyche*
3. *International Journal of Jungian Studies*
4. *The Journal of Analytical Psychology*

We believe *Spring* is the ideal venue given its archetypal orientation and openness to innovative work, but we wanted to indicate our broader journal strategy.
