**Status:** UTSA/DTSA compliant

---

### ✅ Trademark Protection

**Registered:**
- Soullab® - Registered trademark

**Common Law Trademarks (Unregistered):**
- MAIA (Multidimensional Archetypal Intelligence Agent)
- Spiralogic
- TransformationalPresence
- Mirror Field Journaling

**Next Step:** Consider registering additional marks

---

### ✅ Patent Strategy

**5 Planned Provisional Applications:**

1. **Breakthrough Detection System**
   - Multi-factor analysis for transformative moments
   - Novel: Emotional intensity + self-awareness + archetypal resonance

2. **Field Resonance Computation**
   - Morphic field calculation → response palette generation
   - Novel: User state → field → palette → optional LLM enrichment

3. **Unified Insight Engine**
   - Cross-context pattern detection (journals, conversations, sessions)
   - Novel: Convergence scoring + spiral tracking + archetypal threading

4. **TransformationalPresence System**
   - Breathing entrainment with visual field coherence
   - Novel: Mode-specific patterns + color transitions + field expansion

5. **Multi-Agent Consciousness Orchestration**
   - Archetypal AI agents around unified center
   - Novel: MainOracle + peripheral agents (Shadow, InnerGuide)

**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Novel (not publicly disclosed)
- ✅ Non-obvious (unique synthesis of neuroscience + alchemy + AI)
- ✅ Useful (practical consciousness development application)
- ✅ Human-invented (0% AI-generated)

**Next Step:** File provisional patents (Q1 2025 target)

---

## AI Usage Policy Established

### ✅ ALLOWED (Utility Services)

**What AI can do:**
1. ✅ Syntax assistance (code completion, error fixing)
2. ✅ Documentation generation (from human specs)
3. ✅ Voice synthesis (text → audio transformation)
4. ✅ Speech-to-text (audio → text transcription)
5. ✅ LLM as execution engine (with human-authored system prompts)

**The Rule:** "If it's MECHANICAL (how), AI can assist."

---

### ❌ PROHIBITED (Co-Creation Risk)

**What AI cannot do:**
1. ❌ System design or architecture
2. ❌ Algorithm development
3. ❌ System prompt creation
4. ❌ Creative decision-making
5. ❌ Business logic design

**The Rule:** "If it's CREATIVE (what/why), humans write it."

---

### System Prompts = Your IP

**Key Insight from COMPLETE_IP_SOVEREIGNTY.md:**

> **"System prompts = your IP, LLM = execution engine"**
>
> Like SQL query (your IP) executed by MySQL (utility database)

**Example:**

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Human-authored system prompt
const MAIA_CONSCIOUSNESS = `[Kelly's 34-year framework]`; // YOUR IP

const response = await claude.messages.create({
  system: MAIA_CONSCIOUSNESS,  // ← YOU own this
  messages: conversationHistory
});

// Result: YOU own the intelligence, Claude just executes it
```
