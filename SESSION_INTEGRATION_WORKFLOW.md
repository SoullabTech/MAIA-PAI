# MAIA Session Integration Workflow
## For 1.5-2 Hour Sessions

**Simple, repeatable process you can use starting tomorrow**

---

## The 3-Phase Session Flow

### PHASE 1: Pre-Session (5 minutes)

**Setup**:
- [ ] Start recording device/software
- [ ] Open MAIA dashboard (optional - can skip at first)
- [ ] Take 3 deep breaths, center yourself
- [ ] Review: Has this client consented to MAIA? (If no, normal session)

**If introducing MAIA for first time**:
- Plan to do it in last 10-15 minutes (not at start)

---

### PHASE 2: The Session (90-120 minutes)

**Your job: BE PRESENT WITH CLIENT** (this is primary)

#### Option A: Dashboard Open (Real-time mode)

**What you'll see**:
- Coherence meter (0-1 scale)
- Current transformation stage (Nigredo/Albedo/Citrinitas/Rubedo)
- Polyvagal state (nervous system)
- Alert flags (yellow = attention, red = safety concern)

**When to glance** (5-10 seconds max):
- ✅ During natural pauses (client silent, reflecting)
- ✅ After significant moments (big emotion, breakthrough)
- ✅ When you feel stuck ("What's happening right now?")

**When NOT to glance**:
- ❌ During active emotional processing
- ❌ When client is vulnerable/crying
- ❌ When YOU are activated (your presence needed, not metrics)

**What to do with what you see**:
- Dashboard shows coherence dropping → Stay present, maybe slow down
- Dashboard flags self-attack pattern → Mental note, explore gently
- Dashboard suggests framework → Consider it, use if fits

**Key rule**: Glance = < 5 seconds. Eyes back to client immediately.

#### Option B: Recording Only (Post-session mode)

**Simpler approach** (recommended for first few sessions):
- Have recording running
- NO dashboard during session
- Focus 100% on client
- Review MAIA analysis after session

**You do the session exactly as you normally would**:
- Follow your clinical intuition
- Use your training and frameworks
- Track coherence/stages in your own awareness
- Let MAIA be your "second opinion" afterward

---

### PHASE 3: Post-Session (15-20 minutes)

**Immediately after**:
- [ ] Stop recording
- [ ] Save/name file: `ClientInitial_Date.mp3`
- [ ] Upload to MAIA platform

**MAIA Analysis** (5-10 min processing):
While MAIA analyzes, you can:
- Take a break
- Write your own session notes
- Prepare for next client

**Review MAIA Report** (10-15 min):

#### Quick Skim (5 min):
1. **Coherence score**: What did MAIA calculate? vs. What did you sense?
2. **Transformation stage**: Does it match your assessment?
3. **Key moments flagged**: Did you notice these too?
4. **Suggested approaches**: Anything useful for next session?

#### Deep Read (Optional, 10 min):
- Full report sections
- Framework effectiveness rankings
- Your own patterns (countertransference alerts)
- Transformation signatures detected

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Note 1-2 insights for next session with this client
- [ ] Track in your pilot spreadsheet (if running pilot)
- [ ] If safety concerns flagged → Follow up immediately

## Session-by-Session Evolution

### First Session with New MAIA Client

**Last 10-15 minutes**:

**YOU**: "Before we stop, I want to mention something I'm starting to use..."

**[Your 2-3 minute intro script]**

**[Answer questions]**

**[Get consent: Yes/No/Think about it]**

**If YES → Start recording NEXT session** (not today)
- Gives them time to process
- No tech during first consent conversation

**If NO → Normal process continues**
- Thank them for considering it
- No MAIA for this client
- Business as usual

---

### Second Session (First MAIA Recording)

**Start of session**:

**YOU**: "Just a reminder, I'll be recording today like we discussed. The recording is just for my review with MAIA. If at any point this feels uncomfortable, let me know and I can turn it off. Sound okay?"

**[Client confirms]**

**YOU**: "Great. Let's begin..."

**[Normal session proceeds]**

**During session**:
- Recording runs in background
- You might glance at dashboard 3-5 times total (brief)
- Client probably won't even notice

**After session**:
- Upload recording
- Review MAIA analysis
- Note: Did MAIA catch anything you missed?

---

### Third Session Onward (Rhythm Established)

**Before**: Quick recording check
**During**: Session as normal, occasional dashboard glance
**After**: MAIA review, insights integrated into next session

**You'll start noticing**:
- MAIA catches patterns across multiple sessions
- You refine when to look at dashboard vs. when to ignore it
- Post-session reviews get faster (10 min instead of 20)
- You develop your own "MAIA literacy"

---

## What to Do with MAIA Insights

### Insight Type 1: Pattern You Missed

**MAIA says**: "Coherence spiked to 0.78 at minute 34 when you stayed silent for 45 seconds after client said 'I'm tired of fighting myself'"

**Your action**:
- Next session → Use more strategic silence
- Watch for similar moments
- Trust pauses more

### Insight Type 2: Stage Transition

**MAIA says**: "Client transitioned from Nigredo (0.28 coherence) to Albedo (0.48) around minute 52"

**Your action**:
- Recognize: They moved from dissolution to clarification
- Next session → Support the clarification (don't rush to integration)
- Framework: Maybe more reflective work, less action planning

### Insight Type 3: Framework Suggestion

**MAIA says**: "IFS (parts work) has 0.89 fit for this moment. Consider: 'It sounds like a part of you feels one way, and another part feels differently?'"

**Your action**:
- IF it resonates → Use IFS language next session
- IF it doesn't → Ignore it, trust your approach
- MAIA suggests, YOU decide

### Insight Type 4: Safety Alert

**MAIA flags**: "Possible crisis - coherence 0.12, dorsal shutdown, self-harm language detected"

**Your action**:
- Assess client directly (don't rely on MAIA alone)
- Follow your crisis protocol
- MAIA is ONE data point, your clinical judgment is primary

## Integration with Your Existing Process

### Your Current Session Structure (Example)

**Your typical 90-120 min session**:
1. Check-in (10 min)
2. Explore presenting issue (20-30 min)
3. Deep work / processing (40-60 min)
4. Integration / grounding (10-20 min)
5. Close / next steps (5-10 min)

### With MAIA Added

**Your session structure stays THE SAME**:
1. Check-in (10 min) - *recording on, dashboard optional*
2. Explore (20-30 min) - *glance at dashboard during pauses*
3. Deep work (40-60 min) - *eyes mostly on client, trust your presence*
4. Integration (10-20 min) - *maybe check coherence: are they integrating?*
5. Close (5-10 min) - *normal closing*

**+ 15 min after**: Review MAIA report

**Total time added**: 15-20 min post-session

---

## Quick Decision Tree

**During session, when do I look at dashboard?**

```
Am I feeling uncertain what's happening?
├─ YES → Quick 5-sec glance at coherence/stage
└─ NO → Stay with client, trust your intuition

Is there a natural pause?
├─ YES → Can glance if curious
└─ NO → Don't interrupt flow

Did something significant just happen?
├─ YES → After client settles, brief check
└─ NO → Continue as normal

Is dashboard distracting me?
├─ YES → CLOSE IT, post-session only
└─ NO → Keep it open, use sparingly
```

## First Week Recommendations

### Day 1-2: Introduce MAIA to 1-2 clients
- Use last 10-15 min of session
- Get consent
- Don't record yet (unless they're ready)

### Day 3-4: First recordings (post-session analysis only)
- NO dashboard during session
- Record, upload, review after
- Learn what MAIA analysis looks like

### Day 5-7: Try dashboard in session (optional)
- Open it, but minimal view
- Glance 3-5 times max per session
- See if it helps or distracts

### Weekend: Evaluate
- Which approach felt better? Dashboard or post-only?
- Did MAIA catch anything useful?
- Will you continue or adjust?

---

## The Core Principle

**MAIA is your colleague behind the one-way mirror**

- Client can't see MAIA
- MAIA observes patterns
- You're still in the room, fully present
- After session, MAIA gives you supervision

**Your relationship with client = PRIMARY**
**MAIA = SUPPORT**

Never reverse that.

---

## What Success Looks Like

**After 5-10 MAIA sessions, you should**:
- ✅ Know when to glance at dashboard vs. stay focused
- ✅ Review post-session reports in 10-12 min (down from 20)
- ✅ Have 2-3 specific examples where MAIA helped you see something
- ✅ Feel like MAIA enhances (not replaces) your clinical judgment
- ✅ Have integrated it into your workflow smoothly

**If any of those are FALSE**:
- Something needs to adjust
- Either the tool, or how you're using it
- That's valuable feedback for iteration

## Starting Tomorrow: Your Workflow

**Pre-session** (5 min):
- Start recording ✓
- Center yourself ✓

**Session** (90-120 min):
- Be present with client ✓
- Optional: Glance at dashboard 3-5 times ✓

**Post-session** (15 min):
- Upload to MAIA ✓
- Review analysis ✓
- Note insights ✓

**That's it. Simple.**

---

**Questions?**

- "Should I use dashboard or not?" → Try post-only first, add dashboard week 2
- "How many times can I look?" → 3-5 glances max per session
- "What if it distracts me?" → Close it, post-session analysis only
- "What if client notices?" → "Just checking my notes" or be transparent

**You're ready.**

Run your sessions like you always do. Let MAIA be the quiet observer. Review the insights after. Adjust as you go.
