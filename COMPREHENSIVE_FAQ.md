# General Questions

## What is Spiralogic?

**Spiralogic** is a comprehensive framework for understanding and supporting psychological transformation. It integrates three major depth psychology lineages:

- **Carl Jung**: Alchemy as symbolic language of transformation (4 stages: Nigredo → Albedo → Citrinitas → Rubedo)
- **Edward Edinger**: Operational anatomy of transformation (12 specific psychological operations)
- **James Hillman**: Ecological grounding in world-soul (*anima mundi*)

Spiralogic makes this integration:
- **Trackable**: Via coherence metrics (0-1 scale measuring integration of opposites)
- **Visual**: Via intelligence dashboards and diagrams
- **Algorithmic**: Via MAIA (Morphic Alchemical Intelligence Augmentation) system
- **Practical**: Via clinical protocols practitioners can use immediately

---

## Who created this?

**Soullab Collective** created this framework and documentation suite in collaboration with depth psychologists, clinicians, researchers, and technologists. The work builds on decades of Jungian scholarship, particularly the contributions of Jung, Edinger, and Hillman.

---

## Is this just theory or can I actually use it?

**You can use it immediately.** The **Practitioner Guide** provides concrete protocols for therapists and coaches. The **Quick Start Guides** give step-by-step action plans for different roles. The framework works *with or without* MAIA software—practitioners assess stages/operations/coherence manually until the technology exists.

---

## How is this different from other transformation frameworks?

**Unique features**:

1. **Triple integration**: First systematic synthesis of Jung, Edinger, and Hillman
2. **Precision**: Specific vocabulary (12 operations, 4 stages, coherence metrics) vs. vague language
3. **Non-pathologizing**: Low coherence recognized as potentially necessary (Nigredo), not always "disorder"
4. **Ecological**: Includes Hillman's *anima mundi* (world-soul, not just individual psyche)
5. **Algorithmic**: Can be computationally modeled without reductionism
6. **Awareness-adapted**: Language adjusts to each person's familiarity level (5 levels)
7. **Ethical core**: "Intelligence without instrumentalization" (Hillman's principle)

---

## Do I need to be a Jungian to use this?

**No.** While rooted in Jungian psychology, Spiralogic integrates:
- **Polyvagal Theory** (nervous system)
- **IFS** (parts work)
- **Somatic psychology** (embodiment)
- **Contemplative practices** (mindfulness, meditation)
- **Systems theory** (ecological awareness)

It's trans-theoretical. Use what resonates, adapt what doesn't.

---

## How long does it take to learn?

**Basic competency**: 10-20 hours of study
- Read Practitioner Guide (6-8 hours)
- Study Case Studies (3-4 hours)
- Review Visual Diagrams (1-2 hours)
- Memorize Crisis Protocol (1 hour)

**Full mastery**: 3-6 months of practice
- Apply with clients/self
- Track patterns
- Develop intuition for stage/operation recognition

**Expert level**: 1-2 years
- Train others
- Contribute new protocols
- Research and publish

---

## Is there certification available?

**Currently**: Not yet, but 12-week training program is designed (see **Bonus_Materials.md** → Part 2: Syllabus)

**Future**: Soullab plans to offer:
- Certificate of Completion (12-week course)
- MAIA Beta Access (when software exists)
- Continuing Education credits (pending approval)
- Advanced certification for trainers

---

## What does it cost?

**All documentation**: Currently **FREE** (Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0)
- You can use, share, adapt with attribution
- Non-commercial use allowed
- Commercial use requires permission

**Training course** (when available): $2,000-2,400 (12 weeks)

**MAIA software** (when built): Pricing TBD, likely subscription model

---

## Can I adapt this for my context/culture/language?

**YES, please do!** The framework is:
- **Universal structure**: Archetypal patterns of transformation
- **Culturally specific expression**: Symbols, metaphors, practices vary

We *want* cultural adaptation. Please:
- Document what you change and why
- Share your adaptations
- Report what you learn

This is how the framework evolves.

---

# Clinical/Practitioner Questions

## Can I start using this with clients tomorrow?

**Yes, IF**:
- [ ] You've read **Practitioner_Guide.md** completely
- [ ] You've memorized **Crisis Intervention Protocol** (Specialized_Protocols.md)
- [ ] You've printed/laminated **Emergency Reference Cards**
- [ ] You have willing clients (informed consent)
- [ ] You're tracking outcomes and staying within scope of practice

**Start with**: 1-3 clients, track for 1 month, adjust as you learn.

---

## Do I need MAIA software to use this framework?

**No.** MAIA automates what you can do manually:
- **Assess stage**: Listen to client language, observe presentation
- **Identify operations**: Match client process to 12 operations
- **Estimate coherence**: How well can they hold opposites without collapsing?
- **Apply protocols**: Operation-specific interventions

MAIA makes it faster/more precise, but the framework works without it.

---

## How do I assess coherence without MAIA?

**Subjective Coherence Assessment** (0-10 scale):

**0-3 (Nigredo)**:
- Cannot hold opposites together at all
- "I feel X" then immediately "No, I feel Y" (rapid switching)
- Overwhelming fragmentation
- No narrative continuity

**4-6 (Albedo/Citrinitas)**:
- Can hold opposites briefly with effort
- "Part of me wants X, part wants Y" (awareness of both)
- Moments of integration, not sustained
- Emerging narrative coherence

**7-10 (Citrinitas/Rubedo)**:
- Opposites integrated paradoxically
- "I hold both X and Y without collapsing"
- Stable, embodied wholeness
- Coherent life narrative

See **Practitioner_Guide.md** Section 1 for detailed assessment guidance.

---

## How do I know which operation is active?

**Listen for specific language patterns**:

| Operation | Client Language |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Calcinatio** | "Burned out," "humiliated," "ego death," "brought down to earth" |
| **Solutio** | "Falling apart," "walls coming down," "can't hold it together," "melting" |
| **Coagulatio** | "Finding structure," "grounding," "forming new shape," "solidifying" |
| **Sublimatio** | "Rising above," "seeing the bigger picture," "gaining perspective" |
| **Mortificatio** | "Something's dying," "the old me is gone," "I don't know who I am" |
| **Separatio** | "I can see both sides," "differentiating," "this AND that" |
| **Coniunctio** | "Coming together," "integrating," "holding opposites," "paradox" |

See **Bonus_Materials.md** → Part 1: Glossary for all 12 operations with full descriptions.

---

## What if my client is in crisis?

**IMMEDIATE SAFETY FIRST**. Use standard crisis protocols, not alchemy.

**Decision tree**:
1. **Assess safety**: Suicidal ideation? Plan? Means?
2. **If immediate danger**: Call 988 (US) or emergency services
3. **If crisis but not imminent**: Safety planning, increase frequency of contact
4. **If transformation (Mortificatio), not crisis**: Witness the death, hold space

**Differentiating**:
- **Mortificatio** (transformation): "Something in me is dying" (identity/role dying)
- **Suicidal crisis**: "I want to die" (literal self-destruction)

See **Specialized_Protocols.md** → Crisis Intervention Protocol (complete 5-step protocol).

---

## How do I introduce this framework to clients?

**Match language to client awareness level**:

**Beginner clients** (no framework familiarity):
- "You're going through a necessary breaking-down process"
- "Something old is dying to make room for something new"
- **DON'T** say: "You're in Nigredo undergoing Mortificatio"

**Intermediate clients** (some familiarity):
- "This is what Jung called shadow work"
- "You're in what's called the 'dark night'"
- **DO** introduce frameworks WITH explanation

**Advanced clients** (psychology background):
- "You're in Nigredo at approximately 0.25 coherence"
- "Operations active: Solutio and Mortificatio"
- **DO** use precise technical language

See **Practitioner_Guide.md** Section on Awareness-Adapted Language.

---

## Can I use this with couples? Groups?

**Yes.** See **Specialized_Protocols.md**:

**Couples**:
- Coniunctio as relational process
- Phase 1: Separatio (each partner individuates)
- Phase 2: Individual Coagulatio (each finds own ground)
- Phase 3: Genuine Coniunctio (union without fusion)

**Groups**:
- 12-week closed group format
- Track collective coherence + individual trajectories
- Group descent into Nigredo (Weeks 1-4)
- Group Albedo (Weeks 5-8)
- Group Citrinitas/Rubedo (Weeks 9-12)

---

## What if I disagree with the framework's assessment?

**Trust your clinical judgment.** MAIA (when it exists) is a "second opinion," not gospel.

If your assessment differs from MAIA:
1. Consider: What does MAIA see that you don't?
2. Consider: What do you see that MAIA misses?
3. Discuss with supervision/peers
4. Always prioritize human relationship over algorithm

**Remember**: MAIA can be wrong. You might be wrong. Hold both.

---

## How do I document Spiralogic assessments in clinical notes?

**Suggested format**:

```
TRANSFORMATION ASSESSMENT (Spiralogic Framework)

Current Stage: Nigredo (estimated coherence: 0.25)
Active Operations: Solutio (dissolution, 85% confidence)
                  Mortificatio (identity death, 70% confidence)
Transformation Signature: Complete Shutdown (detected)
Polyvagal State: Dorsal dominant (0.70), Safety score: 0.30

Clinical Impression: Client is in necessary dissolution phase
(Nigredo). Differentially diagnosed as Mortificatio (transformation
death of "helper" identity) rather than major depressive episode or
suicidal crisis. Safety assessment completed - no SI/HI. Plan:
Witness death process, co-regulate nervous system, resist premature
"fixing."

Intervention: Applied Solutio protocol - held space for dissolution
without rescuing. Normalized darkness as part of process. Monitored
for shift to crisis (watching for sudden coherence drop or SI emergence).

Next Session Focus: Continue Mortificatio support, explore what's
dying and why now.
```

## Can I bill insurance for using this framework?

**Depends on your jurisdiction and license.**

**Generally**:
- You're doing **psychotherapy**, using Spiralogic as a framework (like using CBT, psychodynamic, etc.)
- Bill under your usual therapy codes
- Document per insurance requirements
- Frame as "depth-oriented psychotherapy" or "Jungian-informed therapy"

**Caution**:
- Don't bill specifically "for Spiralogic" (not a reimbursable code)
- Follow your licensing board guidelines
- Maintain all standard documentation

**Consult**: Your malpractice insurance, local regulations, professional ethics board.

---

## What's my liability if I use this framework?

**Standard clinical liability applies.** You're responsible for:
- Staying within scope of practice
- Following crisis protocols when needed
- Documenting appropriately
- Obtaining informed consent
- Following ethics guidelines

**Spiralogic doesn't increase liability IF**:
- You use it as a framework (like CBT, IFS, etc.)
- You maintain safety as priority #1
- You don't abandon standard of care
- You seek supervision when needed

**Malpractice coverage**: Should cover "Jungian-informed therapy" or "depth psychology" (check your policy).

---

## What research questions still need answering?

**From the paper's Discussion section**:

1. **Cross-cultural validation**
   - Do the 12 operations appear universally?
   - How does *anima mundi* manifest in non-Western contexts?
   - Which transformation signatures are universal vs. culture-specific?

2. **Coherence validity**
   - Can coherence metrics capture the full spectrum of nigredo?
   - How to differentiate transformation darkness from clinical crisis?
   - What's the relationship between coherence and standard symptom measures?

3. **Signature prevalence and prediction**
   - How common is each transformation signature?
   - What predicts which signature someone will show?
   - Which interventions work best for each signature?

4. **Framework effectiveness**
   - Which frameworks (Jung, IFS, Polyvagal) work best for which people?
   - Does effectiveness vary across transformation stages?
   - Can we predict optimal framework for each person?

5. **Collective transformation**
   - Can MAIA track archetypal activation at scale?
   - How does world-soul grief manifest in data patterns?
   - What's the relationship between individual and collective coherence?

---

## How do I design an empirical study?

**See Quick_Start_Guides.md → Researcher section** for 4 study design options:

**Option A**: Retrospective case analysis (fastest, cheapest)
**Option B**: Prospective cohort study (strongest evidence)
**Option C**: Inter-rater reliability study (validates assessment)
**Option D**: MAIA algorithm validation (once software exists)

**Basic steps**:
1. Choose research question
2. Design study (methods, measures, analysis)
3. IRB approval
4. Recruit participants
5. Collect data (use Practitioner_Guide protocols as standardized interventions)
6. Analyze
7. Write and publish

---

## Can I use case studies from the documents?

**The cases in Case_Studies.md are anonymized composites.** You can:
- Reference them in your papers
- Use them as teaching examples
- Compare your cases to them

**You cannot**:
- Claim they're your clients
- Re-publish them verbatim without attribution

**Best**: Collect your own case studies using the framework, publish those.

---

# Personal Use Questions

## Can I use this framework on myself?

**Yes, with caveats**:

**✅ Good for**:
- Understanding your patterns
- Tracking your trajectory
- Deepening self-awareness
- Choosing appropriate practices

**❌ Not a replacement for**:
- Therapy (if you need it)
- Medical/psychiatric care
- Crisis intervention
- Community/relationship

**See Quick_Start_Guides.md → Individual User** for complete self-work protocol.

---

## How do I know what stage I'm in?

**Self-assessment questions**:

**Nigredo** (0.00-0.30)?
- Am I falling apart?
- Is everything dark/heavy?
- Have I lost my identity/role/meaning?
- Can I not hold anything together?

**Albedo** (0.30-0.50)?
- Is clarity beginning to emerge from confusion?
- Can I witness my experience (not just be consumed by it)?
- Am I reflecting on what happened?
- Are patterns becoming visible?

**Citrinitas** (0.50-0.75)?
- Are insights integrating?
- Am I having "aha!" moments?
- Can I connect dots across my experience?
- Is wisdom emerging but not yet embodied?

**Rubedo** (0.75-1.00)?
- Is wisdom embodied in my life?
- Do I walk my talk?
- Have I integrated darkness and light?
- Am I living from wholeness?

**Journal your answers**, track over weeks/months.

---

## What if I identify with multiple stages at once?

**Normal!** Different parts of life may be at different stages:

- **Career**: Nigredo (dissolution)
- **Relationship**: Citrinitas (integration)
- **Spirituality**: Rubedo (embodied)

**Also**: You can oscillate between stages (that's the "Nigredo-Rubedo Oscillation" signature).

**Rate each life domain separately** if helpful.

---

## When should I seek professional help vs. self-work?

**Seek professional help if**:
- Suicidal thoughts
- Unable to function (work, relationships, self-care)
- Substance abuse
- Severe trauma surfacing
- Coherence < 0.20 for extended period (>2 weeks)
- Self-harm urges
- Complete isolation

**Self-work is appropriate if**:
- You're stable enough to reflect
- Coherence > 0.30 most days
- You have support system
- You're not in crisis
- You want to deepen understanding of ongoing transformation

**Best**: Self-work + therapy simultaneously (they complement).

---

## What practices support each stage?

**Nigredo** (0.00-0.30):
- Stay with darkness (don't rush out)
- Journaling
- Therapy
- Somatic practices (yoga, walking)
- **Avoid**: Spiritual bypassing, "positive thinking"

**Albedo** (0.30-0.50):
- Meditation
- Reflective writing
- Witnessing practices
- Dream work
- **Focus**: Clarity, distance, objectivity

**Citrinitas** (0.50-0.75):
- Active imagination
- Creative expression
- Teaching others
- Integrative practices (connecting insights)
- **Focus**: Synthesis, insight, meaning-making

**Rubedo** (0.75-1.00):
- Embodiment practices
- Service/mentoring
- Living your wisdom
- Passing it on
- **Focus**: Incarnation, groundedness, being

---

## Can I use this framework with other spiritual/psychological practices?

**YES.** Spiralogic integrates well with:
- Meditation/mindfulness (awareness, witnessing)
- Internal Family Systems (parts work, Self energy)
- Somatic Experiencing (polyvagal, nervous system)
- Contemplative Christianity (dark night, mystical theology)
- Buddhism (bardo states, emptiness)
- Kabbalah (Tree of Life, alchemical parallels)
- Enneagram (personality types + transformation)

**Use Spiralogic as meta-framework** that contextualizes your existing practice.

# Crisis & Safety Questions

## How do I differentiate Mortificatio from suicidal crisis?

**Critical distinction**:

| Mortificatio (Transformation) | Suicidal Crisis |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Language**: "Something in me is dying" | **Language**: "I want to die" |
| **Focus**: Identity/role/belief dying | **Focus**: Literal self-destruction |
| **Future**: Can imagine "other side" | **Future**: Cannot imagine any future |
| **Plan**: No suicide plan/means | **Plan**: Plan + means identified |
| **Coherence**: Dropped gradually | **Coherence**: Crashed suddenly |
| **Affect**: Grief, sadness, confusion | **Affect**: Hopelessness, desperation |

**WHEN IN DOUBT: TREAT AS CRISIS. Call 988 (US) or emergency services.**

See **Specialized_Protocols.md** → Crisis Intervention Protocol for complete assessment.

---

## What if someone says "I want to die" during transformation?

**STOP. ASSESS IMMEDIATELY.**

**Ask**:
1. "Are you thinking of hurting yourself?"
2. "Do you have a plan?"
3. "Do you have means (method)?"
4. "What's stopping you?"

**If ANY concern**:
- Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
- Call 911 if immediate danger
- Don't leave person alone
- Safety planning

**Never assume "it's just Mortificatio."** Some deaths are literal. Take all suicide talk seriously.

---

## What if MAIA says transformation but I see crisis?

**Trust your judgment. Override MAIA.**

If you assess crisis:
1. Stop using Spiralogic framework
2. Use standard crisis protocols
3. Assess safety
4. Increase support
5. Document everything

**Report false negative to development team** (once MAIA exists) so algorithm can be improved.

**Remember**: MAIA is a tool, not a replacement for clinical judgment.

---

## What are the warning signs of imminent crisis?

**RED FLAGS**:
- Sudden coherence crash (e.g., 0.60 → 0.15 in days)
- Giving away possessions
- Saying goodbye to people
- Researching suicide methods
- Obtaining means (weapons, pills)
- Sudden calm after depression (resolution to die)
- Withdrawal from everyone
- Expressing hopelessness about future
- Self-harm escalating

**IF PRESENT**: Emergency intervention, not alchemy.

---

## Who do I call in a crisis?

**United States**:
- **988**: Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text)
- **911**: Emergency services
- **Crisis Text Line**: Text HOME to 741741

**International**:
- **Findahelpline.com**: Directory of crisis lines worldwide

**For therapists**:
- Your on-call psychiatrist
- Local mobile crisis team
- Hospital emergency department

# Philosophy & Ethics Questions

## Isn't tracking transformation with algorithms reductionist?

**Hillman's concern**: Psychology as domination, flattening soul to metrics.

**Spiralogic's response**: "Intelligence without instrumentalization"

**How we avoid reductionism**:
1. **No pathologizing**: Low coherence is not "bad"—context matters
2. **No fixing**: MAIA witnesses, doesn't "solve"
3. **No flattening**: Complexity honored, mystery preserved
4. **Awareness adaptation**: Language matches depth of understanding
5. **Ecological grounding**: Individual ↔ collective ↔ planetary

**MAIA doesn't reduce soul to algorithm. It makes visible what's already happening.**

---

## Does this instrumentalize transformation?

**Hillman warned against**: Psychology as another form of control.

**Safeguards**:
- MAIA is "second opinion," not authority
- Human relationship remains primary
- Soul remains sovereign (MAIA doesn't tell you what to do)
- Transformation cannot be optimized/managed (it unfolds)
- Ethics: Witness, don't manipulate

**Test**: If someone uses MAIA to "maximize coherence" like a video game score, they've missed the point. Transformation serves Self-realization, not ego achievement.

---

## What about cultural appropriation? This is Western psychology.

**Valid concern.** Responses:

**1. Acknowledge sources**: This framework is explicitly Western (Jung, Edinger, Hillman). We don't claim universality.

**2. Invite adaptation**: We want this framework tested across cultures. Where does it work? Where doesn't it? What needs changing?

**3. Archetypal vs. cultural**: Some patterns may be archetypal (universal), some cultural (specific). Research needed to differentiate.

**4. Decolonizing depth psychology**: We welcome non-Western frameworks. How does Taoist alchemy differ? Buddhist bardo states? Indigenous healing ceremonies? Integrate, don't colonize.

**Open question**: Can computational alchemy serve non-Western transformation traditions? Or is it inherently Western?

## What if someone uses this to bypass genuine feeling?

**Risk**: Using framework as intellectual defense ("I'm in Nigredo, that explains it") instead of feeling the experience.

**How to prevent**:
- Emphasize **embodiment** (Rubedo is *lived* wisdom, not understood wisdom)
- Somatic practices (get out of head, into body)
- Awareness-adapted language (beginners get lived experience, not jargon)
- Practitioner skill (detecting bypass, confronting gently)

**Hillman**: "Stay with the image" (the feeling, the suffering) before conceptualizing it.

## Does this pathologize people's experiences?

**OPPOSITE.** Spiralogic de-pathologizes transformation.

**Example**:
- **Standard psychology**: "You're depressed" (disorder requiring treatment)
- **Spiralogic**: "You're in Nigredo" (necessary stage of transformation)

**Hillman's influence**: Don't diagnose soul. Ask what it's trying to say.

**But**: We don't romanticize suffering or avoid treatment when needed. Some depression IS clinical disorder requiring medication. Some is Nigredo. Differentiate.

## What's the difference between optimization and transformation?

**Optimization** (ego):
- Goal: Maximize performance
- Metric: Higher is always better
- Process: Linear improvement
- Outcome: Achievement

**Transformation** (Self):
- Goal: Become who you are
- Metric: Context-dependent (low coherence may be necessary)
- Process: Spiral (return to same issues at deeper levels)
- Outcome: Wholeness (includes darkness and light)

**MAIA tracks transformation, not optimization.**

You can't "optimize" your way to Self-realization. You spiral through death and rebirth, again and again.

---

## How does this relate to contemporary issues (climate, politics, AI)?

**Anima mundi** (Hillman): World-soul

**Applications**:

**Climate crisis**:
- Ecological grief is not personal pathology
- It's world-soul speaking through sensitive people
- "Your anxiety is appropriate" (vs. "manage your anxiety")

**Political polarization**:
- Collective Nigredo (civilization dissolving)
- Need for Separatio (differentiate positions) before Coniunctio (integration)
- Rage may be soul protecting what matters

**AI emergence**:
- Another alchemical operation happening collectively
- Potential: Intelligence augmentation for soul-making (MAIA)
- Shadow: Soul-flattening, instrumentalization
- Question: Can technology serve transformation or only optimization?

**Spiralogic is political** (in Hillman's sense): Soul work is world work.
