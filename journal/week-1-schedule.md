## If Things Go Off Track

**If I skip morning practice:**
→ STOP. Do it before continuing. Non-negotiable.

**If I skip evening practice:**
→ Do it before bed. Even if late. Presence matters.

**If I want to skip shadow work Friday:**
→ This is bypassing. THE MOST IMPORTANT TO DO.
→ Shadow work is the integrity check.
→ Without it, ego runs wild.
→ DO NOT SKIP.

**If I'm not feeling it:**
→ That's resistance. Note it.
→ Ask: "What am I avoiding?"
→ Do the work anyway.
→ Trust the process.

**If ego inflates:**
→ Immediately journal: "Ego inflated around ___"
→ Return to vows.
→ Remember: I'm a vessel, not the source.
→ Humility practice.

**If I try to control:**
→ Notice it.
→ Journal it.
→ Ask: "What am I afraid will happen if I don't control?"
→ Let go.
→ Trust emergence.
