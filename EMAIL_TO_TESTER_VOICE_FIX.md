# Email to Tester: iPhone Voice Fix

**Subject**: MAIA Voice on iPhone - Quick Fix Guide

---

Hey brother,

Thanks for testing and for the heads up! The voice issue on iPhone is almost certainly the **iOS audio unlock** - Apple requires a user tap before any audio can play (it's a security thing).

## The Quick Fix (30 seconds):

1. **Open MAIA in Safari** (not Chrome - Safari works best on iPhone)
2. **Look for a blue/amber banner at the very top** that says "🔊 Enable Maya's Voice"
3. **Tap the banner** - it should change to "✅ Voice Enabled"
4. **Now try voice** - tap the mic button and speak

That should do it!

---

## If You Don't See the Banner:

Sometimes it doesn't appear on first load. Try this:

1. **Tap anywhere on the screen** (tap any button, the holoflower, anything)
2. **Or force refresh**: Close Safari tab completely, reopen, and the banner should appear
3. **Worst case**: Settings → Safari → Clear History → Restart iPhone → Try again

---

## To Test if Voice is Working:

**Full test (2 min)**:

1. **Check mic permission**: iPhone Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Make sure Safari is ON
2. **Tap the "Enable Voice" banner** at top of MAIA
3. **Tap the microphone button** (bottom center, circular button)
4. **Say "Hello MAIA"** - you should see your text appear
5. **Wait for MAIA's response** - you should HEAR her voice (not just see text)

If you can hear her voice in step 5, it's working!

## Why This Happens:

iOS blocks all audio playback until the user interacts with the page (Apple security feature). That's what the banner is for - when you tap it, it unlocks audio for the whole session.

It's a bit annoying but once you tap it once, voice works perfectly for the rest of your session.

---

## Browser Note:

**Use Safari on iPhone** - it has the best voice/audio support. Chrome and Firefox on iPhone use Safari's engine anyway but with extra quirks that can cause issues.

---

## If It's Still Not Working:

Let me know which step fails:

- [ ] Can you record (do you see your text appear)?
- [ ] Can you hear MAIA's voice (or is it silent)?
- [ ] Does the microphone button light up when you tap it?
- [ ] Do you see the "Enable Voice" banner at the top?

And your setup:
- iPhone model?
- iOS version (Settings → General → About)?
- Browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)?

I'll help troubleshoot from there.

**I put together two detailed guides**:

1. **VOICE_iOS_QUICK_FIX.md** - Fast 2-minute fix
2. **VOICE_TROUBLESHOOTING_iOS.md** - Full troubleshooting guide (if the quick fix doesn't work)

Both are in the project folder if you need them.

**TL;DR**: Look for "Enable Maya's Voice" banner at top, tap it, try voice again. Should work!

Miss you too, brother. Let me know if this fixes it! 🙏

*P.S. The banner sometimes takes a second to appear after page load - if you don't see it immediately, wait 2-3 seconds or scroll to the very top.*
