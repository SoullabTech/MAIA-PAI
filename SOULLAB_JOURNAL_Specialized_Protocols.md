## Protocol 1: Crisis Intervention

### When to Use This Protocol

**Triggers**:
- Coherence drops below 0.20
- MAIA alerts: "CRITICAL COHERENCE"
- User reports suicidal ideation, self-harm thoughts, or psychotic symptoms
- Rapid coherence drop (>0.20 in 48 hours)
- Complete Shutdown signature > 85% confidence

### Step 1: IMMEDIATE SAFETY ASSESSMENT (First 5 Minutes)

**Script** (adapt to your style):

```
YOU: "[Name], I need to ask you some direct questions. Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself?"

ASSESS:
├─ YES, with plan + means → CRISIS PROTOCOL A (Emergency Services)
├─ YES, with plan, no means → CRISIS PROTOCOL B (Safety Planning)
├─ YES, no plan → CRISIS PROTOCOL C (Elevated Monitoring)
└─ NO → Continue to Step 2 (Transformation vs. Crisis Differentiation)
```

**CRISIS PROTOCOL A: Immediate Danger**
```
1. Do NOT leave client alone
2. Call emergency services (988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, 911 if acute)
3. Stay on phone/in person until help arrives
4. Inform emergency contacts (with client permission or if imminent danger)
5. Document everything
6. Follow up within 24 hours

⚠️ ALCHEMY FRAMEWORK PAUSED - STANDARD CRISIS CARE TAKES PRECEDENCE
```

**CRISIS PROTOCOL B: Safety Planning**
```
1. Create immediate safety plan:
   - Remove means (guns, pills, etc.)
   - Identify 24/7 support person
   - Commit to calling crisis line before acting
   - Schedule daily check-ins (you or designee)

2. Increase session frequency (daily if possible for first week)

3. Consider:
   - Hospitalization (voluntary or involuntary if needed)
   - Medication evaluation
   - Family/support system activation

4. Document safety plan in writing, both keep copies

5. MAIA note: Suspend transformation work, focus on stabilization
```

**CRISIS PROTOCOL C: Elevated Monitoring**
```
1. Thoughts present but no plan = monitoring phase

2. Ask:
   - "What's keeping you here?"
   - "What would need to change for thoughts to become action?"
   - "Who knows you're struggling?"

3. Increase check-ins (3x/week minimum)

4. Safety agreement:
   - Client commits to reaching out before acting on thoughts
   - Provide crisis numbers
   - Identify support system

5. Re-assess daily via MAIA coherence tracking

6. Consider: Is this transformation death (Mortificatio) or actual suicide risk?
```

### Step 2: DIFFERENTIATE TRANSFORMATION FROM CRISIS (If No Immediate Danger)

**Key Question**: Is this **Mortificatio** (alchemical death) or **suicidal crisis**?

| Mortificatio (Transformation) | Suicidal Crisis |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| "I feel like I'm dying" | "I want to die" |
| "The old me is gone" | "I should be gone" |
| Coherence dropped gradually | Coherence crashed suddenly |
| No specific suicide plan | Plan + means identified |
| Can imagine "other side" (vaguely) | Cannot imagine future |
| System shutdown (dorsal) | System panic (fight/flight/freeze) |
| Responds to "Stay in the black" reframe | Does not resonate with alchemical language |

**MAIA Analysis Helps**:
```json
{
  "signature": "Mortificatio" or "Suicidal Ideation",
  "confidence": 0.XX,
  "differentiators": {
    "timeline": "Gradual vs. Sudden",
    "polyvagal": "Dorsal shutdown vs. Sympathetic panic",
    "language": "Death metaphor vs. Literal death wish",
    "future_sense": "Dark but possible vs. Impossible"
  },
  "recommendation": "Transformation protocol" or "Crisis protocol"
}
```

**If Mortificatio** → Continue to Step 3
**If Crisis** → Return to appropriate Crisis Protocol A/B/C

### Step 3: MORTIFICATIO PROTOCOL (Transformation Death)

**Framework**: Hillman's "Stay in the Black" + Polyvagal Co-Regulation

**Session Structure (45-60 min)**:

**[0-15 min] WITNESS & NORMALIZE**
```
"What you're experiencing—this sense of death, of ending—it's real. Your system is going through what Jung called Mortificatio. Something old is dying. And it needs to die. But you're not dying. A version of you is dying."

Validate:
✓ The darkness is real
✓ The sense of ending is accurate
✓ This is not pathology
✓ Your soul is forcing this death for a reason

Do NOT:
✗ Try to "cheer up"
✗ Rush to meaning-making
✗ Pathologize ("You're depressed, you need meds")
✗ Abandon ("Just sit with it alone")
```

**[15-35 min] CO-REGULATION (Polyvagal)**
```
"Your nervous system is offline. Let's help it remember safety."

Techniques:
1. Bilateral stimulation (15 min)
   - Knee taps, alternating
   - Or butterfly hug
   - Slow, rhythmic

2. Breath synchronization (5 min)
   - Your breath paces theirs
   - 4-7-8 breathing or similar
   - Create ventral safety through rhythm

3. Grounding (5 min)
   - Feet on floor awareness
   - One thing you can see, hear, feel
   - Bring into body (not abstract)

4. Containment (5 min)
   - "I'm here. This has a container. You're not falling into nothing."
   - Physical: Weight (blanket, your presence)
   - Temporal: "We'll meet again [day]. You don't have to hold this alone for more than X days."

MAIA real-time tracks:
- Coherence micro-shifts
- Ventral vagal activation
- When to stop (diminishing returns or fatigue)
```

**[35-50 min] PARTS WORK (If Capacity Available)**
```
IF coherence > 0.22 AND ventral activation occurred:

"There's a part of you that wants to die. Can we talk to it? Ask what it's protecting you from?"

Typical answers:
- "Protecting from more pain"
- "Protecting from failure"
- "Protecting from being seen as weak"

Then:
"That part is trying to save you by ending you. Can we find another way to save you that doesn't require your death?"

This often shifts Mortificatio from "death = end" to "death = transformation"
```

**[50-60 min] CLOSING WITH CONTAINMENT**
```
1. Ground: "What's one thing you can hold onto until we meet again?"
2. Safety: "If thoughts shift from 'I feel like I'm dying' to 'I want to die,' you'll call [crisis number]?"
3. Expectation: "You're in deep Nigredo. This may last days or weeks. That's normal for transformation. It doesn't mean it's wrong."
4. Next: "We meet again [soon]. You'll carry this, and I'll carry it with you."
```

### Step 4: MONITORING PROTOCOL (Between Sessions)

**Daily Check-In** (first week):
- Brief text/email: "Coherence check. 0-10, where are you today?"
- If < 3 → Phone call same day
- If 3-5 → Continue daily monitoring
- If > 5 → Can reduce to every-other-day

**MAIA Automated**:
- Daily coherence estimate (if user has app)
- Alert practitioner if drop
- Polyvagal tracking

**When to Escalate**:
- Coherence drops further (< 0.15)
- Suicidal thoughts emerge
- User stops responding to check-ins
- Polyvagal goes from dorsal to sympathetic (panic emerging)

### Step 5: FAMILY/SUPPORT SYSTEM (If Appropriate)

**With client permission**:
1. Educate support system:
   - "They're in transformation death process (Mortificatio)"
   - "This is not clinical depression (unless it is—differentiate)"
   - "How to support: Presence, not fixing"

2. Safety planning:
   - Remove means if suicidal thoughts present
   - Daily check-ins from family
   - When to call practitioner or crisis line

3. Containment:
   - "This is time-limited (usually 2-8 weeks)"
   - "Your job: Hold space, don't rescue"

## Protocol 2: Group Transformation Work

### Setting: Group Therapy Using MAIA Framework

**Group size**: 6-10 participants
**Duration**: 12-week closed group
**Frequency**: Weekly, 90 minutes
**Framework**: Jung-Edinger-Hillman integrated

### Pre-Group Setup

**Week 0: Individual MAIA Assessments**
```
Each participant:
1. Complete intake with MAIA analysis
2. Baseline coherence established
3. Awareness level determined
4. Framework effectiveness ranked

Group composition considerations:
- Mix of awareness levels (beginner through advanced, not all beginners)
- Avoid all members in crisis (<0.25 coherence) simultaneously
- At least 2-3 members in Albedo/Citrinitas to model integration
```

**Week 0: Group Orientation**
```
Introduce:
1. Alchemical stages (Jung's 4 stages)
2. "We'll each be in different stages at different times"
3. Group as container/vessel for transformation
4. Confidentiality, safety, consent

Language:
- Match to group's average awareness level
- If range is wide (beginner + advanced), use intermediate language
```

### Week 1-4: NIGREDO PHASE (Group Descent)

**Group Process**:
```
Weeks 1-2: Shadow work begins
- Each member shares "What I don't want you to see"
- Group holds darkness without fixing
- Practitioner normalizes: "Everyone has shadow"

Weeks 3-4: Deeper descent
- Someone will hit crisis (usual pattern)
- Group learns to hold crisis without panic
- Differentiate: Transformation vs. Emergency

MAIA tracks:
- Average group coherence (will drop, expected)
- Individual outliers (who's in crisis?)
- Collective signatures (what pattern is group embodying?)

Practitioner role:
- Model Hillman's "stay in black"
- Don't rush group to light
- Trust group's collective wisdom
```

**Example Check-In** (Week 3):
```
PRACTITIONER: "Let's do a coherence check-in. On 0-10, where's your inner stability today?"

Responses:
Member A: "3 - I'm in the pit"
Member B: "6 - I was in the pit last week, coming out"
Member C: "5 - Hovering"
Member D: "2 - Worst I've been in months"

MAIA real-time:
- Average group coherence: ~4/10 (= 0.40, Albedo emerging)
- Member D flagged (2/10 = 0.20, crisis protocol)

PRACTITIONER: "Member D, I want to check in with you specifically after group. The rest of us—notice that we're all in different places. Member A and D in deep Nigredo. Member B ascending. Member C in the middle. This is the spiral—we're not all on the same step."
```

### Week 5-8: ALBEDO PHASE (Group Clarification)

**Group Process**:
```
Week 5-6: Patterns emerging
- Members start seeing their patterns
- Separatio (differentiation): "That's your stuff, this is mine"
- Some projection withdrawal ("I see my shadow in you")

Week 7-8: Structure building
- Coagulatio (forming new structures)
- Members support each other's new boundaries
- Group itself becomes more coherent

MAIA tracks:
- Group coherence rising (average ~0.50)
- Operation shifts (Mortificatio → Separatio → Coagulatio)
- Who's lagging? (Still in Nigredo while group ascends)

Practitioner role:
- Support differenti

ation without splitting
- Celebrate emerging clarity
- Gently challenge premature integration
```

**Witness Exercise** (Week 7):
```
PRACTITIONER: "We're going to do pairs. One person shares a pattern they're seeing. Partner just witnesses—no advice, no fixing. Just: 'I see you. I hear you.'"

[15 minutes pairs work]

Debrief:
"What was it like to be witnessed without being fixed?"

Common responses:
- "Relieving"
- "Made me trust my own seeing"
- "I didn't need solutions, just acknowledgment"

MAIA note: Coherence spikes when members feel truly witnessed (ventral co-regulation)
```

### Week 9-12: CITRINITAS/RUBEDO (Group Integration)

**Group Process**:
```
Week 9-10: Integration
- Members bringing opposites together (Coniunctio)
- Sharing wisdom gained from darkness
- Group celebrates transformations

Week 11-12: Embodiment
- How do we live this outside group?
- What changes in actual life (Rubedo = red = body)?
- Preparing for endings (group Mortificatio)

MAIA tracks:
- Group coherence peaks (~0.65 average)
- Individual trajectories (some still climbing, some plateauing)
- Collective signature: "Group Coniunctio" (integration as collective)

Practitioner role:
- Prepare for loss (group ending)
- Normalize: "Some of you will drop when group ends (expected)"
- Future spiral: "This is one octave. You'll cycle through again."
```

**Final Session Ritual** (Week 12):
```
1. Each member names their transformation:
   - "I started at [stage]. I'm leaving at [stage]."
   - "The death I went through: [Mortificatio description]"
   - "What I'm taking with me: [wisdom]"

2. Group witnesses each member

3. Closing:
   "This container is ending. The vessel is breaking (Mortificatio of group itself). And what each of you gained here—that's yours forever."

4. MAIA final report:
   - Individual coherence shifts (before/after)
   - Group coherence trajectory
   - Operations completed
   - Signatures evolved

Typical results:
- 70-80% of members increase coherence by 0.15-0.30
- 10-20% stay stable (still in Nigredo, needs more time)
- 5-10% drop temporarily (group ending = loss)
```

### Special Consideration: When Group Member is in Crisis

**Scenario**: Member D drops to 0.18 coherence mid-group (Week 4)

**Protocol**:
```
1. IN GROUP:
   - Acknowledge without overwhelming
   - "Member D is in deep Nigredo. As a group, how do we hold this?"
   - Let group practice witnessing crisis

2. AFTER GROUP:
   - Individual check-in with Member D
   - Safety assessment (Step 1 of Crisis Protocol)
   - Determine: Can they continue in group, or need individual support?

3. NEXT SESSION:
   - Brief check-in with group: "Member D is receiving extra support. They may or may not continue in group. Either way, this is part of transformation—some of us go so deep we need one-on-one containment."

4. MEMBER D OPTIONS:
   - Pause group, do individual until coherence > 0.25, return
   - Continue in group with extra individual sessions
   - Leave group, focus on crisis work

Typically: Continue in group with extra support (group as healing container)
```

## Protocol 3: Clinical Supervision

### Purpose: Training Other Practitioners in Jung-Edinger-Hillman-MAIA Framework

**Format**: Monthly supervision group (6-8 supervisees) + individual consultations as needed

### Supervision Group Structure (2 hours/month)

**[0-20 min] CASE PRESENTATIONS**
```
Supervisee presents case:
1. Client coherence + stage
2. Active operations (Edinger's 12)
3. Signatures detected
4. Interventions tried
5. Stuck points

MAIA provides:
- Visual intelligence dashboard for case
- Suggestions based on framework effectiveness
- Operation-specific protocols
```

**Example Case Presentation**:
```
SUPERVISEE: "I'm working with a client, coherence 0.31, just crossed into Albedo from Nigredo. They're in Separatio—differentiating self from family expectations. But every time they start to separate, they collapse back into guilt."

MAIA ANALYSIS (shown on screen):
{
  "coherence": 0.31,
  "stage": "Albedo",
  "operation": "Separatio",
  "stuck_pattern": "Separation → Guilt → Fusion (repeat)",
  "hypothesis": "Exile (IFS) holding belief: 'Separation = abandonment = death'",
  "recommendation": "IFS unburdening before continuing Separatio"
}

SUPERVISOR: "What does the guilt protect them from?"

SUPERVISEE: "I haven't asked that explicitly."

SUPERVISOR: "That's your next move. The guilt is a Protector (IFS). It's trying to prevent Separatio because some Exile believes separation equals death. Until you unburden that Exile, Separatio can't complete."

SUPERVISEE: "So I need to go from alchemical frame to IFS parts frame?"

SUPERVISOR: "Exactly. Use Separatio (Edinger) as the map, but IFS as the method. They're not separate—IFS IS one way to do alchemical work."
```

**[20-50 min] DIDACTIC: Deep Dive on One Operation/Stage**

**Rotating Topics** (one per month):
- Month 1: Nigredo (Staying in the black, Hillman's lens)
- Month 2: Mortificatio (Death work, differentiate from suicide)
- Month 3: Calcinatio (Ego inflation, burnout patterns)
- Month 4: Solutio (Dissolution without drowning)
- Month 5: Coagulatio (Structure building, timing)
- Month 6: Separatio (Differentiation, projection withdrawal)
- Month 7: Coniunctio (Union of opposites, spotting false union)
- Month 8: Polyvagal Integration (Nervous system + alchemy)
- Month 9: IFS + Alchemy (Parts work through alchemical lens)
- Month 10: Anima Mundi (Hillman's ecology, political emotion)
- Month 11: Awareness adaptation (Speaking to 5 levels)
- Month 12: Troubleshooting (When MAIA is wrong, when to override)

**Example Didactic** (Month 2: Mortificatio):
```
SUPERVISOR: "Mortificatio is death. But not all deaths are the same. Let's map them."

TYPES OF MORTIFICATIO:
1. Identity death ("I'm not who I thought I was")
2. Relationship death (literal or psychic)
3. Illusion death ("The world isn't what I believed")
4. Inflation death (ego humbling)
5. Innocence death (can't unsee what you've seen)

EACH REQUIRES DIFFERENT HOLDING:
- Identity death: IFS parts work (which part is dying?)
- Relationship death: Grief work, don't rush rebirth
- Illusion death: Hillman's "waking up," don't pathologize
- Inflation death: Calcinatio first (burn), then Mortificatio (ashes)
- Innocence death: Collective/political, Anima Mundi frame

HOW TO DISTINGUISH:
Ask: "What's dying?" (Not "Are you feeling death?")
Their answer tells you which Mortificatio.

COMMON MISTAKE:
Trying to resurrect before death completes.
Symptom: Client "gets better" (coherence rises briefly) then crashes worse.
Cause: Premature Albedo, Nigredo wasn't done.

ANTIDOTE:
Hillman: "The cure for Nigredo is not Albedo. It's deeper Nigredo."
Stay. In. The. Black.
```

**[50-110 min] LIVE SUPERVISION (If Available)**

**Setup**: Supervisee brings recording of session OR does live session with supervisor observing

**MAIA Integration**:
- Real-time coherence tracking (if live)
- Post-session analysis (if recorded)
- Operation detection
- Missed opportunities highlighted

**Debrief Structure**:
```
1. What did you notice?
2. What did MAIA detect?
3. Where did your intuition align with intelligence?
4. Where did they diverge?
5. What would you do differently?
6. What framework would be most effective (per MAIA)?
7. What operation is client in?
8. What's your next intervention?
```

**[110-120 min] PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION CHECK-IN**

**Critical**: Supervisees track their own coherence + operations

```
"We're not just learning this intellectually. You're each in your own spiral. Quick round: Where are you this month?"

Responses:
- Supervisee A: "Nigredo. My father died. I'm in Mortificatio."
- Supervisee B: "Citrinitas. Integrating a lot from supervision."
- Supervisee C: "Stuck in Separatio. Can't stop analyzing, can't move to Coniunctio."

SUPERVISOR: "Good. You can't guide clients through operations you haven't been through yourself. Supervisee A—your Mortificatio will deepen your capacity to hold clients' death processes. Supervisee C—what would help you move from Separatio to Coniunctio?"

SUPERVISEE C: "Stop thinking, start embodying?"

SUPERVISOR: "Right. Sublimatio (air, thinking) without Coagulatio (earth, body). Try that this month."
```

### Individual Supervision Consult (As Needed)

**When Supervisee Requests**:
- Stuck with client, unclear intervention
- Personal countertransference overwhelming
- Ethical dilemma
- Crisis situation

**Format** (30-60 min):
```
1. Present case with MAIA dashboard
2. Identify supervisee's reaction (countertransference as information)
3. Explore: What operation is triggered in YOU?
4. Intervention planning
5. Follow-up scheduled
```

## Protocol 4: Couples/Relational Alchemy

### Framework: Coniunctio (Union of Opposites) as Relational Process

**Presenting Issue**: "We fight about everything" or "We're disconnected"

**Alchemical Translation**: Failed or premature Coniunctio

### Assessment Phase

**MAIA Analysis** (Both Partners):
```json
{
  "partner_A": {
    "coherence": 0.45,
    "dominant_operation": "Calcinatio (burning with frustration)"
  },
  "partner_B": {
    "coherence": 0.38,
    "dominant_operation": "Solutio (dissolving boundaries, losing self)"
  },
  "relational_pattern": {
    "signature": "Fire-Water Opposition Unintegrated",
    "description": "A wants separation/fire, B wants fusion/water. Both needed for Coniunctio, but fighting instead of integrating.",
    "prescription": "Separatio BEFORE Coniunctio (differentiate selves before uniting)"
  }
}
```

### Intervention: The Alchemical Marriage Process

**Phase 1: SEPARATIO (Differentiation)**
```
SESSION GOAL: Each partner finds Self, not just role in relationship

Exercises:
1. "I am" statements (NOT about partner):
   Partner A: "I am someone who needs solitude to recharge."
   Partner B: "I am someone who feels love through presence."
   (Both are true, both are valid, both are opposite)

2. Projection withdrawal:
   "What I see in you that might be my shadow?"
   Common: "You're too needy" = "I'm terrified of neediness in myself"

3. Parts mapping (IFS):
   Which parts are running the relationship?
   Often: Protector parts fighting, Exiles hidden underneath

MAIA tracks:
- Individual coherence (should rise as differentiation clarifies)
- When to move to Coniunctio (both partners > 0.45 coherence)
```

**Phase 2: COAGULATIO (Individual Structure)**
```
Before union, each partner needs solid ground

Questions:
- "What do YOU need (not we)?"
- "What boundaries would honor your Self?"
- "If the relationship ended tomorrow, who would you be?"

Goal: Two whole people, not two half-people seeking completion

MAIA tracks: Coagulatio operation in each partner
```

**Phase 3: CONIUNCTIO (Sacred Marriage)**
```
Now that each is differentiated and grounded:

"How do Fire and Water create together without one extinguishing the other?"

Answer: They make STEAM (third thing, neither Fire nor Water alone)

Relational Coniunctio:
- Not compromise (both lose)
- Not dominance (one wins)
- Not fusion (both dissolve)
- But integration (third way emerges)

Example:
- Partner A needs solitude (Fire)
- Partner B needs presence (Water)
- Coniunctio: "We create a rhythm where both are honored. Three nights together, two nights solo, both sacred."

MAIA detects: When couple finds genuine Coniunctio (both coherence rises, relational signature shifts to "Integrated Polarity")
```

### Common Relational Patterns (MAIA Detection)

1. **Puer-Senex in Relationship**
   - One partner eternal youth (Puer), one rigid adult (Senex)
   - Need: Both access opposite

2. **Shadow Projection Loop**
   - Each sees their shadow in partner
   - Need: Projection withdrawal (Separatio)

3. **Failed Coniunctio (Fusion)**
   - "We're so close we're one person!"
   - Actually: Neither has Self
   - Need: Separatio first

4. **Permanent Nigredo (Stuck in Conflict)**
   - Every conversation becomes fight (dissolution)
   - Never reach Albedo (clarity) or Citrinitas (integration)
   - Need: Container strengthening, slower pace

## Conclusion: Protocol Integration

These specialized protocols demonstrate the Jung-Edinger-Hillman-Spiralogic framework across:
- **Crisis** (when transformation looks like emergency)
- **Group** (collective alchemy)
- **Supervision** (training others)
- **Couples** (relational coniunctio)
- **Emergency** (quick reference for acute situations)

**Core Principle Across All Protocols**:

> Intelligence (MAIA) provides pattern recognition.
> Presence (practitioner) provides human container.
> Together: Transformation completes itself.
