## Two Ways to Shape Your Experience

We've added **two independent mode systems** that let you customize your conversations with MAIA:

### 1️⃣ **Voice Listening Modes** - How MAIA hears you

Choose how long MAIA waits before responding to your voice:

| Mode | Pause Time | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| **💬 Dialogue** | 3.5 seconds | Natural back-and-forth conversation |
| **🤔 Patient** | 8 seconds | Gathering thoughts, deeper reflection |
| **🎙️ Scribe** | Manual finish | Long monologues, stream of consciousness |

**Where to find it:** Look for the "Dialogue \| Patient \| Scribe" buttons during voice conversations

---

### 2️⃣ **Conversation Personality Modes** - How MAIA responds

Choose MAIA's response style and depth:

| Mode | Icon | Response Style |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Walking** | 🚶 | Brief, ambient (1-3 sentences) - like walking with a friend |
| **Classic** | 🏠 | Full therapeutic depth with poetic language |
| **Adaptive** | 🔄 | Matches your energy and communication style |

**Where to find it:** Look for the QuickModeToggle (shows 🚶/🏠/🔄 icon) in the MAIA interface

---

## Why Two Systems?

They work **together** to give you full control:

### Example Combinations:

**Patient + Walking**
→ MAIA takes time to hear you, then responds briefly
→ *Best for: Processing emotions without overwhelming responses*

**Dialogue + Classic**
→ Quick conversation flow with full depth
→ *Best for: Engaged therapeutic dialogue*

**Scribe + Adaptive**
→ Speak freely without interruption, MAIA adapts to your style
→ *Best for: Journal-like monologues with personalized reflection*

---

## How to Use

### Voice Listening Modes (Voice only):
1. Start a voice conversation with MAIA
2. Click **Dialogue**, **Patient**, or **Scribe** buttons
3. Notice how MAIA's listening changes immediately

**Pro tip:** Use **Scribe mode** when you want to speak for several minutes without MAIA interrupting. Click "I'm Done Speaking" when ready for her response.

### Conversation Personality Modes (Voice & Text):
1. Look for the mode indicator (🚶/🏠/🔄)
2. Click to switch between Walking → Classic → Adaptive
3. Try asking the same question in different modes to feel the difference

## 🧪 What to Test This Week

We'd love your feedback on:

1. **Which listening mode feels most natural?**
2. **Which personality mode do you use most often?**
3. **Do the mode combinations make sense?**
4. **Any combinations that don't work well together?**
5. **Are the mode names clear, or would different labels help?**

---

## Technical Notes

**Both systems are fully deployed** and working on production right now. They're:
- ✅ Persistent across sessions (your preferences are saved)
- ✅ Work independently (mix and match freely)
- ✅ Available on all MAIA interfaces
- ✅ Compatible with the voice recognition fix from last week

---

## Questions?

- **"Can I change modes mid-conversation?"** Yes! Switch anytime.
- **"Do modes affect voice quality?"** No, only timing (listening) and response style (personality).
- **"Which mode is default?"** Dialogue + Classic (the original MAIA experience).
- **"Does this work with Elemental Alchemy?"** Yes, all elemental patterns work across all modes.
